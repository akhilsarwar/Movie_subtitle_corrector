<i>The entire world
is a collection of memoranda</i>

3
0:1:15,966 --> 0:1:19,866
<i>that she did exist,
and that I have lost her.</i>

4
0:1:19,899 --> 0:1:22,101
<i>Whatever our souls are made of,</i>

5
0:1:22,134 --> 0:1:24,732
<i>hers and mine are the same.</i>

6
0:1:25,67 --> 0:1:27,999
<i>A rather pretentious way
to open our story...</i>

7
0:1:28,33 --> 0:1:30,632
<i>but I've always
had a flair for the dramatic.</i>

8
0:1:30,666 --> 0:1:33,334
<i>You see, this is</i> our <i>story...</i>

9
0:1:33,366 --> 0:1:35,267
<i>Tessa's and mine.</i>

10
0:1:35,301 --> 0:1:37,134
<i>It's a story
you've heard before,</i>

11
0:1:37,167 --> 0:1:40,33
<i>passed down from the Greeks,
through Shakespeare,</i>

12
0:1:40,67 --> 0:1:42,766
<i>the Brontes, Jane Austen.</i>

13
0:1:43,201 --> 0:1:46,799
<i>It's the story of a young girl
exploring her independence,</i>

14
0:1:46,833 --> 0:1:49,766
<i>free from the bonds
of her oppressive parent...</i>

15
0:1:49,799 --> 0:1:53,366
<i>and promised to a boy
she clearly does not love.</i>

16
0:1:53,400 --> 0:1:55,833
<i>She meets a dashingly
handsome young man</i>

17
0:1:55,866 --> 0:1:58,101
<i>who sweeps her off her feet...</i>

18
0:1:58,134 --> 0:2:2,34
<i>even though he represents
everything she detests.</i>

19
0:2:2,67 --> 0:2:4,101
<i>She falls for him,</i>

20
0:2:4,134 --> 0:2:6,301
<i>gives herself to him,</i>

21
0:2:6,333 --> 0:2:9,101
<i>and is ultimately
betrayed by him</i>

22
0:2:9,134 --> 0:2:11,234
<i>and left shattered.</i>

23
0:2:11,866 --> 0:2:16,67
<i>Only it is he who is
destroyed by his deceit.</i>

24
0:2:16,533 --> 0:2:19,0
<i>When it feels as though
all is lost,</i>

25
0:2:19,34 --> 0:2:23,267
<i>the two reunite
and live happily ever after.</i>

26
0:2:23,300 --> 0:2:27,366
<i>Like I've said,
a story you've heard before.</i>

27
0:2:27,400 --> 0:2:29,732
<i>Only difference is...</i>

28
0:2:29,966 --> 0:2:32,101

- Piss off.
- I'm looking for someone.

37
0:3:25,366 --> 0:3:27,134

Whoo! Sure don't seem
like Christmas out here,

44
0:3:48,766 --> 0:3:50,866
all this heat we've been havin'.

45
0:3:50,899 --> 0:3:53,300
Ya know, I hate the heat.

46
0:3:53,333 --> 0:3:56,266
Heat make people
do some crazy things.

47
0:3:56,300 --> 0:3:58,699
Hoo!

48
0:4:10,134 --> 0:4:12,233
Thank... Thank you!

49
0:4:12,732 --> 0:4:14,833
Sorry.

50
0:4:17,866 --> 0:4:20,233
Excuse me! Sir, can you
hold that elevator, please!

51
0:4:20,266 --> 0:4:22,366
Asswipe!

52
0:4:26,833 --> 0:4:29,34
Thank you.

53
0:4:29,766 --> 0:4:32,200
Did you call me an asswipe?

54
0:4:32,233 --> 0:4:34,34
Excuse me?

55
0:4:34,67 --> 0:4:36,967
You just called me an asswipe.

56
0:4:37,0 --> 0:4:39,67
Um, no. I didn't.

57
0:4:39,666 --> 0:4:42,366
Yeah, I guess
I just imagined it.

58
0:4:42,400 --> 0:4:44,699
Guess so.

59
0:4:45,34 --> 0:4:48,0
Ya know, I <i>was</i> trying
to hold the elevator for you.

60
0:4:48,34 --> 0:4:50,134
Sure you were.

61
0:4:52,833 --> 0:4:55,0
Look, I'm sorry.
It's my first day.

62
0:4:55,34 --> 0:4:57,0
I'm just trying
to make an impression.

63
0:4:57,34 --> 0:5:0,799
Well, you certainly
succeeded at that.

64
0:5:2,366 --> 0:5:4,666
Asswipe.

65
0:5:11,133 --> 0:5:12,300
No, no, no, no...

66
0:5:12,333 --> 0:5:14,67
- You work here?
- Surprise.

67
0:5:14,101 --> 0:5:15,266
Tessa!

68
0:5:15,300 --> 0:5:17,34
Welcome to Vance Publishing.

69
0:5:17,67 --> 0:5:18,699
Hi. Kimberly, right?

70
0:5:18,732 --> 0:5:20,300
Excellent memory.
I'm impressed.

71
0:5:20,333 --> 0:5:21,967
Yes, she makes
quite the impression.

72
0:5:22,0 --> 0:5:22,900
You two know each other?

73
0:5:22,934 --> 0:5:25,233
Uh... we're old friends.

74
0:5:25,266 --> 0:5:27,699
Now, if you ladies
will excuse me?

75
0:5:27,732 --> 0:5:29,300
- Are you excited to get going?
- Yeah.

76
0:5:29,333 --> 0:5:31,766
Let's introduce you to the boss.

77
0:5:31,799 --> 0:5:35,34
Shut the fuck up
and listen to me!

78
0:5:35,67 --> 0:5:37,766
This might not be
the best time for introductions.

79
0:5:37,800 --> 0:5:41,0
Why don't I
show you your office?

80
0:5:41,34 --> 0:5:42,934
Trevor!

81
0:5:42,967 --> 0:5:45,67
On it.

82
0:5:49,333 --> 0:5:51,166
I apologize for the mess.

83
0:5:51,200 --> 0:5:52,834
We've been short
on interns lately,

84
0:5:52,867 --> 0:5:54,300
and we're a bit backlogged.

85
0:5:54,333 --> 0:5:55,967
That seems crazy to me.

86
0:5:56,0 --> 0:5:58,100
People I know would kill
for an internship here.

87
0:5:58,133 --> 0:5:59,666
I know, it's just that Vance

88
0:5:59,699 --> 0:6:1,732
has this small problem with

89
0:6:1,766 --> 0:6:3,133
firing them after a day.

90
0:6:3,166 --> 0:6:4,421
But that's not
going to happen to you.

91
0:6:4,433 --> 0:6:6,366
I have a good feeling
about this.

92
0:6:6,400 --> 0:6:8,834
But like I said
during the interview,

93
0:6:8,867 --> 0:6:10,666
your job is to read
five manuscripts a week,

94
0:6:10,699 --> 0:6:13,0
and if you like them,
just forward them on to me.

95
0:6:13,34 --> 0:6:15,200
- Okay.
- The kitchen is right down the hall.

96
0:6:15,233 --> 0:6:17,366
Feel free to place
any order for lunch.

97
0:6:17,400 --> 0:6:19,867
- Any questions?
- Uh, no. I'm good.

98
0:6:19,900 --> 0:6:22,100
You got this.

99
0:7:18,33 --> 0:7:20,233
Mmm.

100
0:7:21,100 --> 0:7:23,166
Mr. Vance!

101
0:7:23,967 --> 0:7:25,999
Um... Um, I'm so sorry.

102
0:7:26,33 --> 0:7:27,400
I must have dozed off.

103
0:7:27,433 --> 0:7:29,867
- What time is it?
- 9:25.

104
0:7:31,733 --> 0:7:33,834
9:25?

105
0:7:33,867 --> 0:7:35,967
- Am I fired?
- Sit down.

106
0:7:36,500 --> 0:7:38,867
You mean to tell me
you read three books

107
0:7:38,900 --> 0:7:41,33
and did coverage
on all of them last night,

108
0:7:41,66 --> 0:7:45,733
and you think <i>Carnival of Light</i>
by Niko Tanaka is a great read?

109
0:7:45,767 --> 0:7:47,632
Yeah, it is. It's, uh,

110
0:7:47,666 --> 0:7:49,66
she has a really original voice,

111
0:7:49,100 --> 0:7:51,200
it's a lot like
an early Margaret Atwood,

112
0:7:51,233 --> 0:7:52,822
<i>The Edible Woman,</i>

113
0:7:52,834 --> 0:7:56,33
- <i>Surfacing...</i>
- I'm coming down now.

114
0:7:56,533 --> 0:7:58,999
Grab your things.
Come with me.

115
0:7:59,33 --> 0:8:1,133
Oh, shit.

116
0:8:6,300 --> 0:8:7,999
Morning, Mr. Vance.

117
0:8:8,33 --> 0:8:10,100
- Morning, sir.
- Mr. Vance, I was just...

118
0:8:10,133 --> 0:8:12,233
I was wondering if we had time
to go back to...

119
0:8:12,266 --> 0:8:13,800
Get in.

120
0:8:13,834 --> 0:8:16,233
Because I have to get
my phone charger in at...

121
0:8:16,266 --> 0:8:18,966
Oh, we're closing the door!

122
0:8:20,433 --> 0:8:22,834
Little work tip.

123
0:8:22,867 --> 0:8:25,366
- Hmm?
- It helps if you don't wear the same clothes every day.

124
0:8:25,400 --> 0:8:26,999
That, and showering.

125
0:8:30,433 --> 0:8:32,633
Um, where are we going?

126
0:8:32,667 --> 0:8:34,366
There's a digital
publishing conference,

127
0:8:34,400 --> 0:8:36,700
and I need to secure
some funding for my expansion.

128
0:8:40,800 --> 0:8:42,867
Fuck off!

129
0:8:43,999 --> 0:8:47,66
What part of "We're closed"
don't...

130
0:8:47,100 --> 0:8:48,733
- Hi.
- You busy?

131
0:8:48,767 --> 0:8:50,700
Kind of in the middle
of something.

132
0:8:50,733 --> 0:8:55,33
So, you know, why don't you
come back tomorrow?

133
0:8:55,66 --> 0:8:57,366
Or just come in right now.

134
0:9:2,233 --> 0:9:3,733
I'm good.

135
0:9:3,767 --> 0:9:6,600
Come on, it'll ease the pain.

136
0:9:7,133 --> 0:9:9,400
I like the pain.

137
0:9:9,433 --> 0:9:13,667
Well, suit yourself,
you fuckin' masochist.

138
0:9:19,233 --> 0:9:21,133
Welcome back the Montgomery,
Mr. Vance.

139
0:9:21,166 --> 0:9:23,66
I have your rooms ready for you.

140
0:9:23,100 --> 0:9:25,767
We had a printer delivered
to Mr. Trevor Matthews' room.

141
0:9:25,800 --> 0:9:27,899
Unfortunately, Ms.
Young's room wasn't ready,

142
0:9:27,933 --> 0:9:30,354
so we had her upgraded to a suite
with compliments of the management.

143
0:9:30,366 --> 0:9:32,33
Has Mr. Jiang checked in yet?

144
0:9:32,66 --> 0:9:33,767
I do believe he's at the bar.

145
0:9:33,800 --> 0:9:34,999
Of course he is.

146
0:9:35,33 --> 0:9:37,200
So I get a printer
and you get a suite.

147
0:9:37,233 --> 0:9:38,667
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

148
0:9:38,700 --> 0:9:40,333
Definitely.

149
0:9:40,366 --> 0:9:42,166
Hon', do you mind
taking Tessa shopping?

150
0:9:42,200 --> 0:9:43,421
She needs something for tonight.

151
0:9:43,433 --> 0:9:45,733
I trust you.

152
0:9:46,866 --> 0:9:48,999
Let's go have some fun.

153
0:9:51,433 --> 0:9:53,133
Are you sure that I can get in?

154
0:9:53,166 --> 0:9:55,166
Because I've never been
to a nightclub before.

155
0:9:55,200 --> 0:9:57,166
But don't they check...?

156
0:9:57,200 --> 0:10:0,834
You'll be with us.
It won't be a problem.

157
0:10:0,866 --> 0:10:3,366
Look, before we go outside,

158
0:10:3,733 --> 0:10:5,366
I just wanted
to tell you something.

159
0:10:5,400 --> 0:10:6,667
Okay.

160
0:10:6,700 --> 0:10:8,800
Vance and I are...

161
0:10:9,700 --> 0:10:11,800
more than co-workers.

162
0:10:12,133 --> 0:10:13,833
Oh.

163
0:10:13,866 --> 0:10:16,899
It was strictly
a work thing for years,

164
0:10:16,933 --> 0:10:18,667
especially after his wife died,

165
0:10:18,700 --> 0:10:21,633
then I started helping out
with his son Smith,

166
0:10:21,667 --> 0:10:25,66
and, well, love can
really take you by surprise.

167
0:10:25,100 --> 0:10:27,133
Yes, it can.

168
0:10:30,833 --> 0:10:32,333
- That's him?
- Mm-hmm.

169
0:10:32,366 --> 0:10:35,133
- Aw.
- He's the sweetest kid.

170
0:10:36,66 --> 0:10:38,166
Ohh.

171
0:10:38,200 --> 0:10:41,933
Can't wait for them to see you
in this dress tonight.

172
0:10:41,966 --> 0:10:44,66
Oh, shoot.

173
0:10:44,501 --> 0:10:46,33
We forgot to buy you underwear.

174
0:10:46,66 --> 0:10:47,999
But my clothes
are at the laundry.

175
0:10:48,33 --> 0:10:50,300
If I leave now,
I can run back to the mall...

176
0:10:50,333 --> 0:10:51,933
Oh, no, no, no.
No. It's fine.

177
0:10:51,966 --> 0:10:54,66
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

178
0:10:54,568 --> 0:10:58,66
Okay, I guess
we're goin' commando, then.

179
0:11:4,33 --> 0:11:6,633
I can't believe I've been
at Vance for only a day.

180
0:11:6,667 --> 0:11:10,100
Well, Hardin said we'd
be lucky to have you.

181
0:11:10,133 --> 0:11:13,833
- You spoke to Hardin.
- No, Vance did.

182
0:11:13,866 --> 0:11:15,667
He didn't tell you?

183
0:11:15,700 --> 0:11:18,200
Must have slipped his mind.

184
0:11:49,899 --> 0:11:54,866
Yes, well, as long as we're
at the conference by two...

185
0:11:57,434 --> 0:11:59,266
Wow.

186
0:11:59,300 --> 0:12:1,568
You clean up nicely.

187
0:12:2,400 --> 0:12:4,766
Gee, Trevor, you sure know
how to charm the ladies.

188
0:12:4,799 --> 0:12:6,266
Tessa, you look stunning.

189
0:12:6,300 --> 0:12:8,166
Thank you.

190
0:12:8,200 --> 0:12:10,300
On the move.

191
0:12:21,300 --> 0:12:23,166
So what books have you written?

192
0:12:23,200 --> 0:12:25,300
Oh, this and that.

193
0:12:32,100 --> 0:12:34,100
Feel like I'm sitting
at the kids' table.

194
0:12:34,133 --> 0:12:35,766
Thanks.

195
0:12:35,799 --> 0:12:37,933
No, that's not what I meant.
Sorry.

196
0:12:37,966 --> 0:12:39,300
I hate nightclubs.

197
0:12:39,333 --> 0:12:41,401
Probably because
I suck at dancing.

198
0:12:41,434 --> 0:12:43,799
I love Ohio football,
but I hate nightclubs.

199
0:12:43,833 --> 0:12:45,933
Why are we here?

200
0:12:46,866 --> 0:12:48,366
Him.

201
0:12:48,401 --> 0:12:50,367
Mr. Jiang.

202
0:12:50,401 --> 0:12:52,966
His family owns
a hedge fund worth 800 million

203
0:12:52,999 --> 0:12:56,401
and it's considering
investing in Vance's expansion.

204
0:12:56,434 --> 0:12:57,766
You want me to get you a drink?

205
0:12:57,799 --> 0:12:59,233
I'm gonna stick with water.

206
0:12:59,266 --> 0:13:1,333
All my budget
really allows these days.

207
0:13:1,367 --> 0:13:3,367
I thought you were
a paid intern.

208
0:13:3,401 --> 0:13:6,333
You'd be surprised how much
Uber charges can add up.

209
0:13:6,367 --> 0:13:8,766
I mean, I'd be lucky
to break even.

210
0:13:11,833 --> 0:13:14,33
- I'll go.
- What it is?

211
0:13:16,434 --> 0:13:18,732
Sex on the Beach.

212
0:13:19,434 --> 0:13:20,899
Quite a beach.

213
0:13:23,300 --> 0:13:26,999
Grab a straw.
On your mark, get set, go.

214
0:13:33,233 --> 0:13:35,632
It's really good.

215
0:13:35,666 --> 0:13:37,921
Mr. Jiang, have you had a chance
to look at my numbers yet?

216
0:13:37,933 --> 0:13:39,799
With the forecast of
rising interest rates...

217
0:13:40,866 --> 0:13:42,200
Again. Just...

218
0:13:42,233 --> 0:13:44,334
Yeah.

219
0:13:47,33 --> 0:13:49,833
We're gonna
get fucked up tonight!

Well, well, look what

224
0:14:10,133 --> 0:14:12,33
That's a stupid
fucking expression.

225
0:14:12,66 --> 0:14:14,266
Why would a cat
drag me anywhere?

226
0:14:14,301 --> 0:14:16,599
Welcome back, bro.

227
0:14:20,66 --> 0:14:22,166
Did you miss us?

228
0:14:30,534 --> 0:14:32,866
Wait.
I don't get it.

229
0:14:32,899 --> 0:14:34,999
Of course you don't.

230
0:14:35,899 --> 0:14:37,999
This is great!

231
0:14:41,33 --> 0:14:43,866
I feel like dancing!

232
0:14:52,866 --> 0:14:54,401
Guess who.

233
0:14:54,434 --> 0:14:55,966
Okay, I'll give you a hint.

234
0:14:55,999 --> 0:14:58,267
She's super fuckin' hot,
a lot of fun,

235
0:14:58,301 --> 0:15:0,233
and <i>loves</i> to fuck.

236
0:15:0,267 --> 0:15:2,732
- Mother Teresa.
- No. Ew.

237
0:15:3,166 --> 0:15:5,301
Ta-da!

238
0:15:5,334 --> 0:15:8,367
I know, I look amazing.
I've had, like, no carbs in eight weeks,

239
0:15:8,401 --> 0:15:10,367
- but I'm feeling fucking fantastic.
- Wow.

240
0:15:10,401 --> 0:15:12,322
Yeah, its from the lack of
carbs and not all the blow.

241
0:15:12,334 --> 0:15:13,787
Don't you have some carpets
to munch on?

242
0:15:13,799 --> 0:15:15,79
Don't you have
some dick to suck?

243
0:16:18,234 --> 0:16:21,666
What do I have to do
to make you forgive me?

244
0:16:21,699 --> 0:16:24,666
- I know I've been really bad.
- Worse than bad.

245
0:16:24,699 --> 0:16:27,334
Yeah, but you like it
when I'm bad.

246
0:16:27,367 --> 0:16:29,666
You know you miss me.

247
0:16:33,732 --> 0:16:35,833
Now get the fuck off me.

248
0:16:37,133 --> 0:16:38,267
Whoa!

249
0:16:38,301 --> 0:16:40,699
What the fuck, Hardin?!

250
0:16:41,201 --> 0:16:43,322
Hardin, you didn't mind fucking me
before, though, right?

251
0:16:43,334 --> 0:16:45,632
Oh, let me guess.

252
0:16:45,966 --> 0:16:48,167
You're still moping
over that stuck-up bitch.

253
0:16:48,201 --> 0:16:49,833
Don't fuckin' talk about her,
okay?!

254
0:16:49,866 --> 0:16:52,666
Look at you. You look
like a lost little puppy

255
0:16:52,699 --> 0:16:54,367
over some
Virgin Mary-turned-skank

256
0:16:54,401 --> 0:16:58,367
who doesn't even want you!

257
0:16:58,401 --> 0:17:0,699
Ohhh, God.

258
0:17:0,966 --> 0:17:3,334
What the fuck you looking at,
freshman?

259
0:17:3,367 --> 0:17:8,234
You want me to steal your boyfriend?
So turn the fuck around.

260
0:17:8,267 --> 0:17:10,367
I look hot.

261
0:17:21,66 --> 0:17:22,101
Tessa?

262
0:17:22,134 --> 0:17:23,866
Hi! I just, uh,

263
0:17:23,899 --> 0:17:25,267
I just wanted to inform you

264
0:17:25,301 --> 0:17:27,367
that I look hot,

265
0:17:27,400 --> 0:17:28,933
and you're missing it.

266
0:17:28,966 --> 0:17:31,33
Tessa, where are you?

267
0:17:31,66 --> 0:17:32,933
Whoo! Somewhere that you're not.

268
0:17:32,966 --> 0:17:35,766
Tess, I have your location,
I can find you.

269
0:17:35,799 --> 0:17:38,301
♪ How much have you had to drink?

270
0:17:38,334 --> 0:17:40,334
I don't know, like five?

271
0:17:40,367 --> 0:17:41,367
Five what?

272
0:17:41,400 --> 0:17:43,732
Uh, Sex on the Beaches.

273
0:17:44,367 --> 0:17:47,134
Or is it Sexes on the Beaches?

274
0:17:47,766 --> 0:17:50,67
That coulda been fun!

275
0:17:50,101 --> 0:17:51,833
You are wasted.

276
0:17:51,866 --> 0:17:54,134
Oh, hey, Hardin?
I'm the commander.

277
0:17:54,167 --> 0:17:56,400
<i>I've been the commander
all night.</i>

278

I'm not wearing any underwear!

- <i>Aaah! Ha ha ha!</i>
- Tess, who are you with?

282
0:18:4,833 --> 0:18:6,799
Why haven't you called me?

283
0:18:6,833 --> 0:18:8,134
I've texted you a hundred times!

284
0:18:8,167 --> 0:18:9,334
You haven't replied!

285
0:18:9,366 --> 0:18:11,234
I actually have to go,

286
0:18:11,267 --> 0:18:13,866
but it was nice talking to
you, Mr. Hardin Scott,

287
0:18:13,899 --> 0:18:15,234
so goodbye.

288
0:18:15,267 --> 0:18:18,599
Don't fu... Te...

289
0:18:19,101 --> 0:18:20,334
Tessa.

290
0:18:20,366 --> 0:18:22,366
Trevor!

291
0:18:22,400 --> 0:18:25,101
I'm drunk, uncomfortable,
and I saw a tampon on the ground.

292
0:18:25,134 --> 0:18:26,799
- I'm leaving.
- Yeah, no, me too.

293
0:18:26,833 --> 0:18:28,301
Can we order room service?

294
0:18:28,333 --> 0:18:30,666
I... I want French fries

295
0:18:31,333 --> 0:18:33,666
and... ice cream.

296
0:18:33,699 --> 0:18:35,799
Dow!

297
0:18:37,999 --> 0:18:40,799
Nothin' like a vanilla sundae
at three in the morning.

298
0:18:40,833 --> 0:18:43,67
Yeah,
it sounded better in the moment.

299
0:18:45,234 --> 0:18:47,632
- So... Tessa.
- Hmm.

300
0:18:47,666 --> 0:18:49,366
- Tessa Young.
- Mm-hmm.

301
0:18:49,400 --> 0:18:51,666
Why the hell
are you in publishing?

302
0:18:51,699 --> 0:18:53,833
Well, I love to read...

303
0:18:55,67 --> 0:18:57,167
That makes sense.

304
0:18:57,500 --> 0:18:59,799
What's your favorite book?

305
0:18:59,833 --> 0:19:3,933
It's <i>The Principles of
Economics</i> by Alfred Marshall.

306
0:19:3,966 --> 0:19:5,899
- No, it's not.
- Yeah, it is.

307
0:19:5,933 --> 0:19:8,34
No, I mean...
I mean, like, fiction.

308
0:19:8,67 --> 0:19:10,34
Like... Like a real book.

309
0:19:10,67 --> 0:19:12,34
I don't do fiction.

310
0:19:12,67 --> 0:19:13,833
I mean, have you seen
how I dress?

311
0:19:13,866 --> 0:19:15,366
- You heathen!
- Heathen?

312
0:19:15,400 --> 0:19:17,134
You heathen!

313
0:19:17,167 --> 0:19:19,400
Fiction's an escape
from reality,

314
0:19:19,433 --> 0:19:21,388
it's a way that, like,
you can live a hundred lives,

315
0:19:21,400 --> 0:19:22,933
or even a thousand.

316
0:19:22,966 --> 0:19:24,699
I don't need to live
a thousand lives.

317
0:19:24,732 --> 0:19:28,599
Okay? And I would rather
watch paint dry.

318
0:19:29,400 --> 0:19:32,266
I, um, that wasn't...

319
0:19:32,300 --> 0:19:34,732
No, I... that wasn't
supposed to happen.

320
0:19:47,933 --> 0:19:49,866
Look, I'm telling you,
I know what I'm doing.

321
0:19:49,899 --> 0:19:53,666
We just have to soak it
before it stains.

322
0:19:54,899 --> 0:19:56,266
Can I have your pants?

323
0:19:56,300 --> 0:19:58,234
- Tessa...
- Gimme your pants!

324
0:19:58,266 --> 0:20:1,34
Otherwise it's gonna stain.

325
0:20:8,201 --> 0:20:10,632
<i>Tessa!</i>

326
0:20:10,666 --> 0:20:12,321
- <i>Tessa, open the door.</i>
- Is that Hardin Scott?

327
0:20:12,333 --> 0:20:15,34
<i>Open the door!</i>

328
0:20:18,300 --> 0:20:20,134
Hi.

329
0:20:20,167 --> 0:20:23,833
Are you trying to get me
kicked out of this place?

330
0:20:23,866 --> 0:20:26,699
Yeah,
come on in, why don't you?

331
0:20:26,732 --> 0:20:28,833
Hey...

332
0:20:30,400 --> 0:20:32,34
Hey, Hardin, didn't see ya.
How ya been?

333
0:20:32,67 --> 0:20:34,732
- Fucking Trevor?!
- Time to go, I think.

334
0:20:34,766 --> 0:20:36,155
- I'm just gonna...
- No, you're not.

335
0:20:36,167 --> 0:20:38,134
- I just wanna talk to him!
- No! No...

336
0:20:38,167 --> 0:20:40,34
- Tessa... Tessa...
- Stop!

337
0:20:40,67 --> 0:20:42,632
- Hardin, I think this is a mis...
- Fuck off.

338
0:20:42,666 --> 0:20:44,799
You're such a dick.
Why are you even here?

339
0:20:44,833 --> 0:20:46,366
<i>I'm</i> a dick?

340
0:20:46,400 --> 0:20:48,732
I'm not the one taking
advantage of drunk girls.

341
0:20:48,766 --> 0:20:50,699
You... You do know
that not every guy

342
0:20:50,732 --> 0:20:53,34
is trying to get
in my pants, right?

343
0:20:53,67 --> 0:20:55,266
- You'd be surprised.
- You can't tell me

344
0:20:55,300 --> 0:20:57,955
who I can and can't have sex with,
because it's none of your business anymore!

345
0:20:57,967 --> 0:21:0,632
- Were you going to have sex with him?
- Oh, my God!

346
0:21:0,666 --> 0:21:1,934
- What?
- You're insane!

347
0:21:1,967 --> 0:21:4,934
You're avoiding the question.

348
0:21:10,833 --> 0:21:12,233
What if I was?

349
0:21:12,266 --> 0:21:14,366
What?

350
0:21:15,833 --> 0:21:17,934
You heard me.

351
0:21:18,766 --> 0:21:21,0
What if I was?

352
0:21:21,34 --> 0:21:23,233
What, you don't like that?

353
0:21:23,266 --> 0:21:26,200
You don't like the idea
of Trevor's hands...

354
0:21:26,233 --> 0:21:28,300
all over my body?

355
0:21:29,34 --> 0:21:31,134
Touching me?

356
0:21:35,732 --> 0:21:37,799
I've missed this.

357
0:21:37,833 --> 0:21:41,134
- Tessa, you're drunk.
- Mm-hmm. So?

358
0:21:42,300 --> 0:21:44,666
Tess...

359
0:21:44,699 --> 0:21:46,0
Hmm!

360
0:21:46,34 --> 0:21:47,233
You don't want this?

361
0:21:47,266 --> 0:21:50,34
Of course I want this, but I...

362
0:21:50,333 --> 0:21:53,900
Hardin... you have
two options here.

363
0:21:55,366 --> 0:21:57,632
Either you fuck me,

364
0:21:57,666 --> 0:21:59,867
or you leave.

365
0:21:59,900 --> 0:22:1,967
You decide.

366
0:22:27,967 --> 0:22:30,67
Ohh.

367
0:22:35,300 --> 0:22:38,166
- Do you have a condom?
- Are you sure?

368
0:22:38,200 --> 0:22:40,200
- Why not.
- You'll hate me tomorrow.

369
0:22:40,233 --> 0:22:43,200
Yeah, well, I hate you already.

370
0:22:57,800 --> 0:22:59,666
Tell me I'm the only one.

371
0:22:59,699 --> 0:23:1,732
You're the only one.

372
0:23:24,0 --> 0:23:26,100
Mmm.

373
0:23:41,834 --> 0:23:43,100
- Hi!
<i>- Morning!</i>

374
0:23:43,133 --> 0:23:44,867
- Kimberly!
- <i>You up?</i>

375
0:23:44,900 --> 0:23:46,388
Yeah... no, yeah,
I've been up for a while.

376
0:23:46,400 --> 0:23:48,133
- <i>See you down in five.</i>
- Five minutes?

377
0:23:48,166 --> 0:23:50,66
- <i>Problem?</i>
- Nope, not a problem.

378
0:23:50,100 --> 0:23:52,54
- <i>Meet you in the lobby.</i>
- Okay, I'll be right down.

379
0:23:52,66 --> 0:23:54,767
- <i>Don't be late.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

380
0:23:55,834 --> 0:23:57,934
Shit!

381
0:24:1,800 --> 0:24:3,934
Where are my clothes?!

382
0:24:9,133 --> 0:24:11,233
Ohh!

383
0:24:13,166 --> 0:24:14,900
Tessa!

384
0:24:14,934 --> 0:24:17,33
Come back to bed.

385
0:24:18,200 --> 0:24:20,100
Tessa!

386
0:24:20,133 --> 0:24:22,632
What?!
What do you want?!

387
0:24:23,66 --> 0:24:26,33
The other Tessa.
The one who's nice?

388
0:24:26,66 --> 0:24:29,100
Yeah, well, she's late for work.

389
0:24:33,300 --> 0:24:35,66
- Where are my...
- Why are you so...

390
0:24:35,100 --> 0:24:37,200
Hey! Privacy!

391
0:24:37,599 --> 0:24:40,133
Privacy.
After what we did last night,

392
0:24:40,166 --> 0:24:41,300
you want privacy?

393
0:24:41,333 --> 0:24:42,667
Don't remind me.

394
0:24:42,700 --> 0:24:44,400
Hey, you called <i>me.</i>

395
0:24:44,433 --> 0:24:46,733
I didn't tell you to come here.

396
0:24:46,767 --> 0:24:48,800
Okay, I'm starting
to get the feeling

397
0:24:48,834 --> 0:24:50,922
you're not entirely cool
with what happened last night.

398
0:24:50,934 --> 0:24:52,233
No, I'm not cool with it.

399
0:24:52,266 --> 0:24:53,867
Well, do you want
to talk about it?

400
0:24:53,900 --> 0:24:55,966
Nope. You hurt me
and I can't forgive you.

401
0:24:55,999 --> 0:24:57,679
- That's it.
- So last night meant nothing.

402
0:24:57,700 --> 0:24:58,999
I was drunk.

403
0:24:59,33 --> 0:25:1,900
I called you, you came here...

404
0:25:2,867 --> 0:25:3,999
I made a mistake.

405
0:25:4,33 --> 0:25:5,700
But you obviously missed me.

406
0:25:5,733 --> 0:25:7,733
I didn't know what I was doing.

407
0:25:7,767 --> 0:25:9,266
- From kissing that guy, to...
- What?

408
0:25:9,300 --> 0:25:11,100
- What?
- From kissing?

409
0:25:11,133 --> 0:25:12,900
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.

410
0:25:12,933 --> 0:25:14,633
- You said "kissing that guy."
- No.

411
0:25:14,667 --> 0:25:16,300
- What?! T...
- I need to go.

412
0:25:16,333 --> 0:25:18,300
Tessa, wait. Tessa!

413
0:25:18,333 --> 0:25:21,66
Tessa!

414
0:25:21,933 --> 0:25:24,33
Put your clothes on!

415
0:25:25,133 --> 0:25:27,300
- Who did you kiss?
- No one!

416
0:25:27,333 --> 0:25:28,700
- Was it Trevor?
- No!

417
0:25:28,733 --> 0:25:30,66
My Tessa would never

418
0:25:30,100 --> 0:25:31,633
kiss a fuckin' stranger
at a club.

419
0:25:31,667 --> 0:25:33,800
There is no "your Tessa"
anymore!

420
0:25:33,834 --> 0:25:39,800
Yeah, well, when you were kissing that
guy, I was fucking Molly.

421
0:25:42,366 --> 0:25:44,667
Fuck you!

422
0:25:49,233 --> 0:25:51,333
Fuck!

423
0:25:56,333 --> 0:25:58,633
- Oh!
- Sorry.

424
0:26:0,133 --> 0:26:2,233
Hi.

425
0:26:2,600 --> 0:26:4,767
- Hi.
- Got us some lattes.

426
0:26:4,800 --> 0:26:6,266
Thank you.

427
0:26:8,700 --> 0:26:10,667
Oh. Thank you.

428
0:26:10,700 --> 0:26:13,66
So, interesting night.

429
0:26:13,100 --> 0:26:16,999
Trevor, I'm... so sorry
about last night.

430
0:26:17,33 --> 0:26:19,633
No, don't be. If I showed up
to my girlfriend's hotel room

431
0:26:19,667 --> 0:26:22,366
and I saw a half-naked,
incredibly handsome man there,

432
0:26:22,400 --> 0:26:23,767
I'd react the same way.

433
0:26:23,800 --> 0:26:25,733
Is he still lurking around?

434
0:26:25,767 --> 0:26:27,899
Should I be hiding in the van?

435
0:26:27,933 --> 0:26:29,633
He's the one that
should be hiding,

436
0:26:29,667 --> 0:26:31,899
and we are not together.

437
0:26:33,700 --> 0:26:36,133
How do you two know each other?

438
0:26:36,166 --> 0:26:39,333
- Hardin worked at Vance last year.
- He did?

439
0:26:39,366 --> 0:26:41,866
Yeah. Same position as you,
actually.

440
0:26:41,899 --> 0:26:43,366
Kind of a sad story.

441
0:26:43,400 --> 0:26:46,300
We were best of friends, and...

442
0:26:46,333 --> 0:26:48,133
then we became lovers,

443
0:26:48,166 --> 0:26:51,300
and then I found
a red hair on my pillow.

444
0:26:51,333 --> 0:26:53,633
Hilarious.

445
0:26:53,866 --> 0:26:55,388
Ya know, I didn't peg you
as the bad boy type.

446
0:26:55,400 --> 0:26:58,733
We'll save that
for another time.

447
0:26:59,366 --> 0:27:1,400
My hero. Ohh.

448
0:27:1,433 --> 0:27:3,700
Anyone else feel like death?

449
0:27:3,733 --> 0:27:6,633
I don't know what you two said
or did to Neil last night,

450
0:27:6,667 --> 0:27:9,366
but he just wrote a humongous
check to finance our expansion.

451
0:27:9,400 --> 0:27:11,700
Good job.

452
0:27:24,33 --> 0:27:25,700
What are you doing here?

453
0:27:25,733 --> 0:27:27,733
I need some advice.

454
0:27:27,767 --> 0:27:29,200
Advice?

455
0:27:29,233 --> 0:27:31,66
You want advice from me?

456
0:27:31,100 --> 0:27:32,866
Yeah.

457
0:27:32,899 --> 0:27:34,333
I'm that desperate.

458
0:27:34,366 --> 0:27:36,633
Oh, insults. Great.

459
0:27:36,667 --> 0:27:38,799
I thought you were
an imposter for a second.

460
0:27:38,833 --> 0:27:41,366
- Look, bro, I know I-
- No, step-bro.

461
0:27:41,400 --> 0:27:44,333
I'm not your brother.
You made that very clear.

462
0:27:44,366 --> 0:27:46,833
And if I was Tessa,
I'd never speak to you again, Hardin.

463
0:27:46,866 --> 0:27:49,766
- It's unforgiveable.
- You think I don't know that?!

464
0:27:49,799 --> 0:27:51,766
I know I fucked up!
I know!

465
0:27:51,799 --> 0:27:54,866
She won't return my calls
or texts.

466
0:27:54,899 --> 0:27:57,33
I found out she kissed some guy.

467
0:27:57,66 --> 0:27:59,667
And... And I told her
I fucked Molly.

468
0:27:59,700 --> 0:28:1,966
- You slept with Molly?
- No, I <i>said</i> I did.

469
0:28:1,999 --> 0:28:3,667
That's the point.
I didn't.

470
0:28:3,700 --> 0:28:5,166
I said it to get back at her,

471
0:28:5,200 --> 0:28:7,733
and I-I realized
how stupid that was.

472
0:28:7,766 --> 0:28:9,799
- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck this!

473
0:28:9,833 --> 0:28:13,333
So you're just gonna run away like
you do from everything. Right?

474
0:28:13,366 --> 0:28:15,766
- Where you goin'?
- London.

475
0:28:15,799 --> 0:28:17,966
I was going to take her with me.

476
0:28:17,999 --> 0:28:19,799
I'll see you next year.

477
0:28:19,833 --> 0:28:22,833
Hardin, do you really love her?

478
0:28:22,866 --> 0:28:24,966
No bullshit.

479
0:28:25,999 --> 0:28:27,333
Yes.

480
0:28:27,366 --> 0:28:29,100
Of course I fucking love her.

481
0:28:29,133 --> 0:28:32,366
I've never felt this way
about anyone before!

482
0:28:32,400 --> 0:28:36,166
Just wish I didn't
fuck the whole thing up.

483
0:29:12,401 --> 0:29:14,699
Focus.

484
0:29:16,166 --> 0:29:17,667
Knock knock.

485
0:29:17,699 --> 0:29:19,333
- Hi.
- Hi.

486
0:29:19,366 --> 0:29:21,667
You're probably goin'
out of town for break,

487
0:29:21,699 --> 0:29:24,233
so just wanna say happy
holidays, and a happy birthday.

488
0:29:24,266 --> 0:29:27,33
- It's your birthday, right?
- Tomorrow.

489
0:29:27,66 --> 0:29:29,166
I made you something.

490
0:29:31,699 --> 0:29:33,333
What's... What's this?

491
0:29:33,367 --> 0:29:36,833
It is a cost analysis breakdown

492
0:29:36,866 --> 0:29:38,666
of your weekly Uber expenditure

493
0:29:38,699 --> 0:29:40,999
versus owning a used car.

494
0:29:41,666 --> 0:29:43,633
Okay...

495
0:29:43,666 --> 0:29:46,999
I know. It's just,
turns out you're wasting a lot of money.

496
0:29:47,33 --> 0:29:50,799
I did a little research,
and I found a 2013 Toyota Corolla,

497
0:29:50,833 --> 0:29:52,799
in town, in excellent condition.

498
0:29:52,833 --> 0:29:55,732
I went down to the dealership,
negotiated terms,

499
0:29:55,766 --> 0:29:59,233
and you'd put no money down,
you only pay 150 bucks a month.

500
0:29:59,266 --> 0:30:2,166
Vance also agreed to put your
auto insurance on company policy,

501
0:30:2,200 --> 0:30:3,799
so that's free.

502
0:30:3,833 --> 0:30:5,666
This is, of course,
if you want to do it.

503
0:30:5,699 --> 0:30:6,720
I just like crunching numbers...

504
0:30:6,732 --> 0:30:8,66
Oh, my God!

505
0:30:8,100 --> 0:30:10,100
- I take it you...
- Oh, my God! Mwah!

506
0:30:10,133 --> 0:30:12,233
Thank you.

507
0:30:15,33 --> 0:30:16,899
Bye, Tessa.

508
0:30:21,899 --> 0:30:24,334
So, what do you think?

509
0:30:24,367 --> 0:30:26,401
Well, you know,

510
0:30:26,434 --> 0:30:28,66
it's, uh...

511
0:30:28,100 --> 0:30:29,866
it's very Tessa.

512
0:30:29,899 --> 0:30:31,833
I will take that
as a compliment.

513
0:30:31,866 --> 0:30:33,966
I'm right up there.

514
0:30:37,200 --> 0:30:39,133
How's Dakota?

515
0:30:39,166 --> 0:30:42,133
Um, I'm actually looking
at your birthday horoscope.

516
0:30:42,166 --> 0:30:46,66
So first off,
you share a birthday with...

517
0:30:46,100 --> 0:30:48,599
- Joseph Stalin.
- Great.

518
0:30:49,266 --> 0:30:52,899
- You are a proud, idealistic person...
- Like Stalin.

519
0:30:52,933 --> 0:30:56,66
You are more emotional
than is obvious.

520
0:30:56,100 --> 0:31:0,33
You may solidify
a romantic relationship

521
0:31:0,66 --> 0:31:4,266
or become involved
with a mature partner.

522
0:31:4,301 --> 0:31:6,401
Mature.
That doesn't really sound...

523
0:31:6,434 --> 0:31:8,833
No, it doesn't.

524
0:31:8,866 --> 0:31:10,267
He left for London.

525
0:31:10,301 --> 0:31:12,732
Have you heard from him?

526
0:31:13,133 --> 0:31:15,301
I haven't,
because I blocked him.

527
0:31:15,334 --> 0:31:17,632
That'll work.

528
0:31:19,367 --> 0:31:21,666
Bye.

529
0:31:58,334 --> 0:32:2,33
<i>Whose place is this?</i>

530
0:33:20,999 --> 0:33:23,134
<i>"You can draw me to fire,</i>

531
0:33:23,167 --> 0:33:25,100
<i>"you can draw me to water.</i>

532
0:33:25,134 --> 0:33:27,666
<i>"You can draw me to the gallows,</i>

533
0:33:27,699 --> 0:33:30,267
<i>you can draw me to any death."</i>

534
0:34:3,833 --> 0:34:6,699
Well, here we are.
I could run you a bath

535
0:34:6,732 --> 0:34:8,212
if you'd like to get
more comfortable.

536
0:34:8,234 --> 0:34:10,66
I would love that.

537
0:34:10,101 --> 0:34:15,66
I remember when you and I
used to take baths together.

538
0:34:16,433 --> 0:34:18,367
Oh, my goodness! Tessa?

539
0:34:18,400 --> 0:34:20,666
- Tessa.
- Hardin's mother.

540
0:34:20,699 --> 0:34:22,54
Hardin said you were
gonna be out of town,

541
0:34:22,66 --> 0:34:23,933
I didn't think
I was gonna meet you!

542
0:34:23,966 --> 0:34:25,632
- Yeah.
- My God,

543
0:34:25,666 --> 0:34:27,400
I cannot believe
how pretty you are.

544
0:34:27,433 --> 0:34:29,289
I mean, Hardin said you were the
most beautiful girl in the world,

545
0:34:29,301 --> 0:34:32,400
but honestly, I thought you were
gonna be covered in tattoos,

546
0:34:32,433 --> 0:34:34,366
green hair,
and a piercing on your bean.

547
0:34:34,400 --> 0:34:35,933
- What bean?
- Mum.

548
0:34:35,966 --> 0:34:37,400
Don't be so melodramatic,
Hardin.

549
0:34:37,433 --> 0:34:39,134
You and I are gonna
be the best of friends.

550
0:34:39,167 --> 0:34:40,732
Do you mind if I use the loo?

551
0:34:40,766 --> 0:34:42,301
Yeah, of course.
It's just, um...

552
0:34:42,334 --> 0:34:44,632
Oh, look at you!

553
0:34:46,67 --> 0:34:48,354
- Why are you here?
- I came to get the rest of my stuff.

554
0:34:48,366 --> 0:34:50,155
- You were supposed to be in London.
- I know.

555
0:34:50,167 --> 0:34:51,921
I didn't want to go without
you, so she came here.

556
0:34:51,933 --> 0:34:53,866
Why didn't you tell her
that we broke up?

557
0:34:53,899 --> 0:34:55,899
She was so excited
when I told her first,

558
0:34:55,933 --> 0:34:57,388
- I couldn't ruin it for her.
- Hardin!

559
0:34:57,400 --> 0:34:59,67
She's my mum!
I couldn't tell her

560
0:34:59,101 --> 0:35:1,167
about the stupid bet, okay?
I'm sorry.

561
0:35:1,201 --> 0:35:5,699
I don't expect you
to pretend we're still together.

562
0:35:5,732 --> 0:35:8,67
- It's fine.
- What's fine?

563
0:35:8,101 --> 0:35:11,234
I said it's fine.
I'll play along.

564
0:35:11,267 --> 0:35:13,400
Thank you, Tessa.
Thank you so much.

565
0:35:13,433 --> 0:35:15,167
Thanks for the Kindle.

566
0:35:15,201 --> 0:35:17,333
Fuck! Happy birthday!

567
0:35:17,599 --> 0:35:19,866
- Is it your birthday?
- Yeah, it is.

568
0:35:19,899 --> 0:35:21,766
Why are we not celebrating?

569
0:35:21,799 --> 0:35:24,766
'Cause I... I was just about
to head out of town.

570
0:35:24,799 --> 0:35:27,167
- No!
- Yeah, I'm gonna see my mom.

571
0:35:27,201 --> 0:35:31,866
Can I be selfish and ask
you to stay another night?

572
0:35:32,333 --> 0:35:35,267
Well, my mom's sort of expec...

573
0:35:35,300 --> 0:35:38,666
We don't know when we're
gonna see each other again.

574
0:35:38,699 --> 0:35:41,699
Yeah. I, uh, I...
I guess I can leave tomorrow.

575
0:35:41,732 --> 0:35:43,833
Brilliant, brilliant,
brilliant.

576
0:35:43,866 --> 0:35:47,799
I am gonna whip you up a homemade birthday
cake that is gonna blow your mind.

577
0:35:47,833 --> 0:35:49,167
Cool.

578
0:35:49,201 --> 0:35:50,766
Cool.

579
0:35:57,167 --> 0:35:59,101
I know I'm biased
'cause I'm his mum,

580
0:35:59,134 --> 0:36:2,0
but isn't that just the cutest
little bum you've ever seen?

581
0:36:2,34 --> 0:36:3,766
Oh, my God, Mum, please.

582
0:36:3,799 --> 0:36:5,699
- Hush.
- It's a pretty cute bum,

583
0:36:5,732 --> 0:36:7,699
Hardin.

584
0:36:7,732 --> 0:36:9,0
Right. Well, uh,

585
0:36:9,34 --> 0:36:10,799
you guys are obviously
having lots of fun,

586
0:36:10,833 --> 0:36:13,134
so I'm just gonna clear up,

587
0:36:13,167 --> 0:36:16,266
and then... set myself on fire.

588
0:36:16,300 --> 0:36:18,899
So Hardin tells me you're
an English major as well.

589
0:36:18,933 --> 0:36:22,400
Mm-hmm. I'm in the process
of switching from econ.

590
0:36:22,433 --> 0:36:26,766
I actually just got an
internship at Vance Publishing.

591
0:36:26,799 --> 0:36:28,899
Vance, as in... Christian Vance?

592
0:36:28,933 --> 0:36:31,34
Mm-hmm.

593
0:36:32,134 --> 0:36:35,34
Hardin and I stayed with
Vance for a few years

594
0:36:35,67 --> 0:36:36,766
when Ken and I broke up.

595
0:36:36,799 --> 0:36:38,899
- Really?
- Yeah.

596
0:36:39,599 --> 0:36:41,266
Hardin never mentioned that.

597
0:36:41,300 --> 0:36:42,799
Never mentioned what?

598
0:36:42,833 --> 0:36:45,333
Nothing, darling.
Just girl talk.

599
0:37:14,34 --> 0:37:17,200
I'm just gonna grab a blanket
and sleep on the floor.

600
0:37:17,233 --> 0:37:21,366
You don't think we could
share the bed and not...

601
0:37:21,400 --> 0:37:23,799
- You know.
- Do you?

602
0:37:23,833 --> 0:37:25,699
Well, I'd <i>like</i> to think

603
0:37:25,732 --> 0:37:29,34
that we're not
total Neanderthals.

604
0:37:29,666 --> 0:37:31,766
Okay.

605
0:37:37,934 --> 0:37:39,799
G'night.

606
0:37:39,833 --> 0:37:41,934
Good night.

607
0:37:50,266 --> 0:37:52,366
Um...

608
0:37:53,34 --> 0:37:56,732
I'm gonna leave
early in the morning

609
0:37:57,134 --> 0:37:59,266
to... to head out of town.

610
0:38:3,732 --> 0:38:5,833
Okay.

611
0:38:7,0 --> 0:38:9,967
Thank you for staying tonight.

612
0:38:11,134 --> 0:38:13,266
Thanks for having me.

613
0:38:20,0 --> 0:38:21,333
Sorry.

614
0:38:21,366 --> 0:38:24,67
No. No, it's...
That's okay.

615
0:38:39,900 --> 0:38:41,967
That feels nice.

616
0:38:42,900 --> 0:38:45,0
- Does it?
- Mm-hmm.

617
0:39:1,133 --> 0:39:4,133
- Did you have a nice birthday?
- Yeah, I did.

618
0:39:4,166 --> 0:39:7,867
And thank you again
for the... gift,

619
0:39:7,900 --> 0:39:9,266
it was really thoughtful.

620
0:39:9,300 --> 0:39:12,133
I found it when I was
getting my stuff.

621
0:39:12,166 --> 0:39:14,233
I'm glad you like it.

622
0:39:15,100 --> 0:39:17,800
I love it.

623
0:39:26,533 --> 0:39:28,834
I got a car.

624
0:39:29,233 --> 0:39:31,666
- You got a car?
- Mm-hmm.

625
0:39:32,300 --> 0:39:34,599
What car did you get?

626
0:39:38,166 --> 0:39:40,266
A white one.

627
0:39:42,266 --> 0:39:44,599
Well, happy birthday.

628
0:39:47,66 --> 0:39:49,166
Night.

629
0:39:53,133 --> 0:39:55,233
Good night.

630
0:39:59,300 --> 0:40:1,900
- Good night.
- Good night.

631
0:40:3,800 --> 0:40:5,900
Good night.

632
0:40:17,300 --> 0:40:19,599
- Hardin.
- Huh?

633
0:40:20,0 --> 0:40:22,100
This isn't working.

634
0:40:23,366 --> 0:40:25,666
Why? What's wrong?

635
0:40:26,934 --> 0:40:29,33
Feel.

636
0:40:32,967 --> 0:40:35,66
Oh.

637
0:40:38,700 --> 0:40:40,800
You?

638
0:40:45,33 --> 0:40:47,133
Oh.

639
0:41:5,934 --> 0:41:8,166
Hardin, we should stop.

640
0:41:8,934 --> 0:41:11,33
Okay.

641
0:41:11,266 --> 0:41:12,421
Three seconds and we'll stop.

642
0:41:12,433 --> 0:41:14,733
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

643
0:41:16,733 --> 0:41:18,999
- Three...
- Three...

644
0:41:19,33 --> 0:41:21,100
- two...
- two...

645
0:41:21,834 --> 0:41:23,900
- one.
- One.

646
0:41:31,366 --> 0:41:33,800
- Okay, ten more seconds.
- Okay.

647
0:41:33,834 --> 0:41:35,667
- And then we'll stop.
- Okay.

648
0:41:35,700 --> 0:41:37,800
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

649
0:41:42,66 --> 0:41:45,633
Will you apologize to your mum
for us kidnapping you last night?

650
0:41:45,667 --> 0:41:47,733
I will.

651
0:41:48,933 --> 0:41:52,834
I can't tell you how much it means
to me to see Hardin this way.

652
0:41:52,867 --> 0:41:54,999
What way?

653
0:41:55,33 --> 0:41:57,133
Happy.

654
0:41:59,300 --> 0:42:0,633
What?

655
0:42:3,133 --> 0:42:5,233
- Bye.
- Bye.

- Vroom vroom!
- Noah, hi!

668
0:42:36,999 --> 0:42:38,300
- Hi!
- It's good to see you!

669
0:42:38,333 --> 0:42:39,767
Good to see you too.

670
0:42:39,800 --> 0:42:41,100
Mmm.

671
0:42:41,133 --> 0:42:43,233
Okay...

672
0:42:43,899 --> 0:42:46,921
Your mom told me that you were comin' home
today, so I figured I'd come greet you.

673
0:42:46,933 --> 0:42:48,866
Did she have you on speed dial

674
0:42:48,899 --> 0:42:50,733
the second I crossed
the county line?

675
0:42:50,767 --> 0:42:52,133
I mean,
can you blame her?

676
0:42:52,166 --> 0:42:53,999
She knows a good thing
when she sees it.

677
0:42:54,33 --> 0:42:55,633
- Right.
- Right.

678
0:42:55,667 --> 0:42:57,333
Um, how's senior year?

679
0:42:57,366 --> 0:43:0,33
You know me,
breakin' hearts and takin' names.

680
0:43:0,66 --> 0:43:2,667
- That's you.
- Yeah? Yeah.

681
0:43:2,966 --> 0:43:5,133
Your mom told me
about the internship.

682
0:43:5,166 --> 0:43:7,400
- That's really awesome.
- Thanks. Yeah.

683
0:43:7,433 --> 0:43:9,899
And everything's cool with
the whole thing with your dad.

684
0:43:9,933 --> 0:43:11,834
- What whole thing with my dad?
- What?

685
0:43:11,866 --> 0:43:13,366
N-Nothing. Nothing.

686
0:43:13,400 --> 0:43:16,300
- What do you mean, nothing?
- I-I don't know.

687
0:43:16,333 --> 0:43:19,33
- I thought that she would have...
- Thought she what?

688
0:43:19,66 --> 0:43:21,767
Uh...

689
0:43:22,400 --> 0:43:24,233
Are you kidding?

690
0:43:24,266 --> 0:43:26,866
- Why is she calling you?
- I'm sorry, Tess.

691
0:43:26,899 --> 0:43:28,700
<i>Sorry,
I got stuck at work.</i>

692
0:43:28,733 --> 0:43:30,266
- Is she there yet?
- Mom?

693
0:43:30,300 --> 0:43:32,400
- Carol, she knows!
- Knows what?!

694
0:43:32,433 --> 0:43:34,66
Oh! Tessa's with you.

695
0:43:34,100 --> 0:43:35,633
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything.

696
0:43:35,667 --> 0:43:36,933
What is going on with Dad?!

697
0:43:36,966 --> 0:43:39,33
Okay, that was rude.

698
0:43:39,933 --> 0:43:41,400
I'm just asking you about Dad.

699
0:43:41,433 --> 0:43:42,899
<i>Fine.</i>

700
0:43:42,933 --> 0:43:44,366
Your father wanted to see you,

701
0:43:44,400 --> 0:43:46,700
but I chased him off.

702
0:43:46,733 --> 0:43:48,633
Why are you getting
so worked up about this?

703
0:43:48,667 --> 0:43:50,366
I'm not getting worked up!

704
0:43:50,400 --> 0:43:52,421
I just don't understand why
you'd keep that a secret.

705
0:43:52,433 --> 0:43:56,66
And you never kept
any secrets from me?

706
0:43:56,100 --> 0:43:59,200
<i>Because I can think of
a big one, and so can Noah.</i>

707
0:43:59,233 --> 0:44:1,233
I thought we got past
this little hiccup

708
0:44:1,266 --> 0:44:3,200
once you got your heart broken.

709
0:44:3,233 --> 0:44:5,100
<i>But I can tell by
the sound of your voice</i>

710
0:44:5,133 --> 0:44:6,866
<i>that this not the case.</i>

711
0:44:6,899 --> 0:44:9,200
This boy is not good for you,
Teresa.

712
0:44:9,233 --> 0:44:11,966
- <i>He is just like your father.</i>
- I'm hanging up.

713
0:44:11,999 --> 0:44:15,100
- <i>No! Don't you fucking hang up on me!</i>
- This was a mistake.

714
0:44:15,133 --> 0:44:17,233
<i>Theresa? Theresa?</i>

715
0:44:17,999 --> 0:44:19,866
I blew it.

716
0:44:19,899 --> 0:44:21,667
I blew it, Carol.
I don't know what happened.

717
0:44:51,266 --> 0:44:53,233
Mummy?

718
0:45:3,333 --> 0:45:4,667
No!

719
0:45:4,700 --> 0:45:5,833
Mummy?

720
0:45:5,866 --> 0:45:8,866
Hardin, get back upstairs now!

721
0:45:10,667 --> 0:45:12,166
Hey. Hey, I'm right here.

722
0:45:12,200 --> 0:45:14,300
Hey. Hey.

723
0:45:16,33 --> 0:45:17,899
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

724
0:45:19,166 --> 0:45:21,600
It was just a nightmare.

725
0:45:33,799 --> 0:45:35,100
Morning.

726
0:45:35,133 --> 0:45:38,233
There... um, there's tea.
I... Help yourself.

727
0:45:38,266 --> 0:45:40,366
Thanks.

728
0:45:41,200 --> 0:45:43,66
Is he okay?

729
0:45:43,100 --> 0:45:45,333
- Hmm?
- The nightmares.

730
0:45:45,568 --> 0:45:47,866
I heard him last night.

731
0:45:47,899 --> 0:45:49,999
Um, he's sleeping now.

732
0:45:52,233 --> 0:45:55,266
How long have they
been going on?

733
0:45:56,699 --> 0:45:59,200
Uh, ever since he was eight.

734
0:46:0,899 --> 0:46:2,999
Um, he, uh, well...

735
0:46:4,366 --> 0:46:6,833
He told me...

736
0:46:6,866 --> 0:46:8,766
about that night
and what he saw.

737
0:46:8,799 --> 0:46:10,899
The assault.

738
0:46:11,534 --> 0:46:15,300
Whoa. He's never
told anyone that before.

739
0:46:17,266 --> 0:46:19,966
I'm so sorry for
what happened to you.

740
0:46:19,999 --> 0:46:23,866
I just hoped he'd forget
the whole thing.

741
0:46:26,367 --> 0:46:30,300
But the nightmares kicked in.

742
0:46:30,333 --> 0:46:32,799
Sorry.

743
0:46:32,833 --> 0:46:35,100
And I took him to therapist
after therapist,

744
0:46:35,133 --> 0:46:37,300
but nothing seemed to help.

745
0:46:37,333 --> 0:46:41,799
And then he started
self-medicating with alcohol.

746
0:46:41,833 --> 0:46:43,933
But, um...

747
0:46:46,266 --> 0:46:49,933
...he told me that
the nightmares went away

748
0:46:49,966 --> 0:46:51,966
when he started seeing you.

749
0:46:54,401 --> 0:46:56,699
I didn't know that.

750
0:47:0,166 --> 0:47:1,899
May I ask...

751
0:47:1,933 --> 0:47:4,300
why does your mum
hate him so much?

752
0:47:4,334 --> 0:47:6,732
Um, Hardin's your son...

753
0:47:7,334 --> 0:47:9,600
Yes, and I love him,

754
0:47:10,66 --> 0:47:13,300
but he is <i>not</i> without
his challenges.

755
0:47:13,334 --> 0:47:17,833
You can tell me.
What happened between you two?

756
0:47:20,100 --> 0:47:22,200
He lied to me.

757
0:47:22,799 --> 0:47:25,367
- A big lie?
- A massive lie.

758
0:47:26,699 --> 0:47:28,799
Is he sorry?

759
0:47:30,699 --> 0:47:32,233
He is.

760
0:47:32,266 --> 0:47:35,766
What are you
two gabbing on about?

761
0:47:35,799 --> 0:47:37,799
Make sure you brush your teeth.

762
0:47:37,833 --> 0:47:40,899
He used to give me such a hard
time about brushing his teeth.

763
0:47:40,933 --> 0:47:42,632
Mum, for the love of God,

764
0:47:42,666 --> 0:47:44,301
of course I'm gonna
brush my teeth.

765
0:47:44,334 --> 0:47:46,401
Great. Morning!

766
0:47:46,434 --> 0:47:49,666
- Morning. Thank you.
- Kisses:

767
0:47:50,301 --> 0:47:52,367
I love your mom.

768
0:47:53,33 --> 0:47:55,133
She's all right.

769
0:47:57,933 --> 0:48:0,33
Happy belated.

770
0:48:0,534 --> 0:48:2,999
But you already got me a gift.

771
0:48:3,33 --> 0:48:5,33
True, but you
had to snoop around

772
0:48:5,66 --> 0:48:6,999
and open it without me,
thus denying me

773
0:48:7,33 --> 0:48:9,999
the pleasure of watching
you react to said gift.

774
0:48:10,33 --> 0:48:12,133
Therefore...

775
0:48:13,200 --> 0:48:15,301
"Tessa's perfect day."

776
0:48:16,833 --> 0:48:18,899
What's my perfect day?

777
0:48:18,933 --> 0:48:20,866
Well, that's for you to decide.

778
0:48:20,899 --> 0:48:23,66
Whatever your wish or desire,

779
0:48:23,100 --> 0:48:27,899
I will agree to without
any snide remarks or tantrums.

780
0:48:27,933 --> 0:48:31,234
Your time starts in three,
two, one.

781
0:48:33,200 --> 0:48:35,234
Isn't this nice?

782
0:48:35,267 --> 0:48:38,401
I always wanted
to go ice skating.

783
0:48:38,434 --> 0:48:41,133
Yeah, it's... great.
I'm loving...

784
0:48:41,166 --> 0:48:43,301
Unhh! Unh...

785
0:48:43,334 --> 0:48:45,367
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

786
0:48:45,401 --> 0:48:47,66
Just a tad rusty.

787
0:48:47,100 --> 0:48:48,899
When was the last time
you skated?

788
0:48:48,933 --> 0:48:51,166
I've never skated before.

789
0:48:51,200 --> 0:48:52,833
Do you want me
to get you a walker?

790
0:48:52,866 --> 0:48:55,33
You're doing great.

791
0:48:55,66 --> 0:48:57,301
Fuck no!

792
0:48:57,334 --> 0:49:1,66
Are you... Oh, it's okay.
It's... it's okay.

793
0:49:1,100 --> 0:49:3,201
Whoo.

794
0:49:3,732 --> 0:49:6,33
- Are you okay?
- Yup.

795
0:49:6,367 --> 0:49:8,666
Do you want to stop?

796
0:49:8,899 --> 0:49:11,133
No. We're here to have...

797
0:49:12,100 --> 0:49:15,66
Unhh! Aaah!

798
0:49:15,100 --> 0:49:17,899
Hardin?
I have a better idea.

799
0:49:17,933 --> 0:49:20,267
Stretch out into Child's Pose,

800
0:49:20,301 --> 0:49:24,334
and let the day's
tension just melt away.

801
0:49:24,367 --> 0:49:26,899
It's not the pose
melting this tension away,

802
0:49:26,933 --> 0:49:28,933
- it's the fucking heat.
- Shh!

803
0:49:28,966 --> 0:49:31,666
- Is there any air-conditioning?
- It's hot yoga.

804
0:49:31,699 --> 0:49:34,732
From Child's Pose,
lift, and slowly press back

805
0:49:34,766 --> 0:49:37,799
into your Downward Facing Dog.

806
0:49:37,833 --> 0:49:39,267
Did anyone ever tell you

807
0:49:39,301 --> 0:49:41,899
you have the most amazing bum?

808
0:49:41,933 --> 0:49:43,666
Stop.

809
0:49:43,699 --> 0:49:46,666
...and slowly move into
<i>salamba sarvangasana.</i>

810
0:49:46,699 --> 0:49:49,201
Excuse me,
is this beginner's yoga?

811
0:49:49,234 --> 0:49:53,267
That was at ten-thirty.
This is acro-yoga.

812
0:49:54,933 --> 0:49:58,966
...and then lift
them up and towards the ceiling.

813
0:49:58,999 --> 0:50:1,100
Breathe together.

814
0:50:3,966 --> 0:50:7,100
Inhale, lift your arms overhead.

815
0:50:9,66 --> 0:50:11,833
And as you exhale,
lean forward.

816
0:50:11,866 --> 0:50:15,999
Allow your partner's
weight to lean into you.

817
0:50:16,33 --> 0:50:18,699
Slowly breathe and
open your legs and...

818
0:50:18,732 --> 0:50:20,833
wider... inhale...

819
0:50:22,234 --> 0:50:23,933
a little wider...

820
0:50:23,966 --> 0:50:27,732
and if you can,
put your legs even wider.

821
0:50:34,400 --> 0:50:37,632
Is yoga supposed
to be a turn-on?

822
0:50:40,66 --> 0:50:42,334
Are you turned on?

823
0:50:42,367 --> 0:50:43,899
Mm-hmm.

824
0:50:43,933 --> 0:50:45,866
- Can we leave then?
- Mm-hmm.

825
0:50:45,899 --> 0:50:48,999
- Now? Let's go.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

826
0:50:49,866 --> 0:50:51,966
Sweaty! I am sweaty!

827
0:50:52,267 --> 0:50:55,101
Wait! Just give me
five minutes, okay?

828
0:50:55,134 --> 0:50:57,966
I just need to get...

829
0:51:3,134 --> 0:51:5,234
Oh, my God. Hardin.

830
0:51:8,799 --> 0:51:12,766

It's my boss,
I have to get this.

0:52:56,933 --> 0:52:59,34
Are you serious?

862
0:52:59,467 --> 0:53:2,234
Hi! Kimberly,
what's wrong?

863
0:53:4,201 --> 0:53:6,333
Oh, no. How can we help?

864
0:53:7,34 --> 0:53:8,167
Hmm.

865
0:53:8,201 --> 0:53:9,632
Hi.

866
0:53:9,666 --> 0:53:11,967
You have no idea
how much of a lifesaver

867
0:53:12,0 --> 0:53:13,167
the two of you are right now.

868
0:53:13,201 --> 0:53:14,833
God, poor Vance caught this bug

869
0:53:14,866 --> 0:53:16,899
and he's throwing up everywhere.

870
0:53:16,933 --> 0:53:18,833
It's no problem.

871
0:53:18,866 --> 0:53:22,0
Okay, who are you and what
have you done with Hardin?

872
0:53:22,34 --> 0:53:24,632
It's part of my birthday present.
I'll tell you later.

873
0:53:24,666 --> 0:53:27,167
Ohh! I'm running so late.

874
0:53:27,201 --> 0:53:30,967
I'll be back in a few hours,
okay? You're in good hands.

875
0:53:31,0 --> 0:53:33,866
- Bye.
- Thank you.

876
0:53:36,934 --> 0:53:39,34
Hi.

877
0:53:39,67 --> 0:53:43,34
Um, so, we have the
whole afternoon together.

878
0:53:43,67 --> 0:53:46,300
- Is there anything that you want to do?
- No.

879
0:53:46,333 --> 0:53:48,934
I could get us some markers
and we can draw!

880
0:53:48,967 --> 0:53:50,766
I don't like to draw.

881
0:53:50,799 --> 0:53:52,899
No? Are you hungry?

882
0:53:54,833 --> 0:53:56,934
No.

883
0:54:6,766 --> 0:54:9,799
Wanna tell me about your trains?

884
0:54:12,666 --> 0:54:14,866
Okay, I don't want
to hear about them anyway.

885
0:54:14,900 --> 0:54:16,866
What are those marks
on your arm?

886
0:54:16,900 --> 0:54:18,366
My tattoos.

887
0:54:18,400 --> 0:54:21,134
- Why do you have them?
- Because I like them.

888
0:54:21,167 --> 0:54:22,866
Don't people think
it looks strange?

889
0:54:22,900 --> 0:54:24,799
I don't give a fuck
what people think.

890
0:54:24,833 --> 0:54:26,934
Which people don't you
give a fuck about?

891
0:54:26,967 --> 0:54:29,233
- Oh, shit. Don't say fuck.
- Shit.

892
0:54:29,266 --> 0:54:31,34
Fuck. Shit.

893
0:54:31,67 --> 0:54:33,134
Fucky fuck. Shit...

894
0:54:33,967 --> 0:54:36,67
- Hey. So...
- Hi!

895
0:54:36,300 --> 0:54:38,321
He is actually hungry now.
We need to get him some...

896
0:54:38,333 --> 0:54:39,821
Fuck. Shit.

897
0:54:39,833 --> 0:54:41,200
Uh, I can go if you want.

898
0:54:41,233 --> 0:54:42,967
- Or you could.
- No, it's fine.

899
0:54:43,0 --> 0:54:44,900
- I'll get us some sandwiches.
- Perfect.

900
0:54:44,934 --> 0:54:47,266
- Thank you so much.
- Whoo! Okay!

901
0:54:47,300 --> 0:54:48,654
- See you later. Bye-bye.
- Okay, bye!

902
0:54:48,666 --> 0:54:51,101
Shit. Fuck. Shit.

903
0:54:53,699 --> 0:54:55,799
Go ahead.

904
0:54:58,101 --> 0:55:0,699
Here,
I can take those now.

905
0:55:0,967 --> 0:55:3,333
You know, she really
brings out the best in you.

906
0:55:3,366 --> 0:55:5,867
Is it that obvious?

907
0:55:5,900 --> 0:55:7,867
Have a nice holiday.

908
0:55:7,900 --> 0:55:10,0
You too.

909
0:55:11,400 --> 0:55:12,766
See ya, mate.

910
0:55:12,799 --> 0:55:14,900
See ya, mate.

911
0:55:21,366 --> 0:55:23,34
You ready?

912
0:55:23,67 --> 0:55:26,133
Yeah. Uh, we're
the last ones here,

913
0:55:26,166 --> 0:55:28,400
so I just have to set the alarm.

914
0:55:28,433 --> 0:55:30,732
Merry Christmas.

915
0:55:32,433 --> 0:55:35,34
Christmas is next week.

916
0:55:37,34 --> 0:55:40,800
I've never been one
to follow the rules.

917
0:55:47,133 --> 0:55:49,233
It says "Whatever our souls
are made of..."

918
0:55:49,266 --> 0:55:51,967
"His and mine are the same."

919
0:55:56,0 --> 0:55:58,100
What's wrong?

920
0:56:1,800 --> 0:56:7,166
I didn't think that I'd see you over the
holidays, so I didn't get you anything.

921
0:56:7,200 --> 0:56:10,66
Is there anything that you want?

922
0:56:12,900 --> 0:56:14,934
Another chance?

923
0:56:17,599 --> 0:56:20,266
Do you promise to act
like this every day?

924
0:56:20,300 --> 0:56:22,599
No.

925
0:56:24,900 --> 0:56:27,0
But I'll try.

926
0:56:34,767 --> 0:56:36,867
Whatever it takes.

927
0:57:4,266 --> 0:57:7,133
We can't do this here.
What if someone comes in?

928
0:57:7,166 --> 0:57:10,300
Helloooo?
Anyone here?

929
0:57:10,900 --> 0:57:12,900
Anyone?!

930
0:57:12,934 --> 0:57:17,700
You just have an answer
for everything, don't you?

931
0:57:30,999 --> 0:57:32,767
It's fake.

932
0:57:32,800 --> 0:57:34,867
Shit.

933
0:59:2,366 --> 0:59:5,366
There's no one else
for me, Tessa.

934
0:59:5,400 --> 0:59:7,700
No one.

935
0:59:11,733 --> 0:59:13,834
I love you.

936
0:59:14,133 --> 0:59:16,867
I love you too.

937
0:59:17,899 --> 0:59:23,100
Don't say "too." Sounds like
you're agreeing with me.

938
0:59:24,33 --> 0:59:26,133
I love you, Hardin.

939
0:59:58,400 --> 0:59:59,999
<i>Trish.</i>

940
1:0:0,33 --> 1:0:1,200
Yeah, it's Ken.

941
1:0:1,233 --> 1:0:3,333
This is a surprise.

942
1:0:3,366 --> 1:0:6,600
So listen, um,
my wife Karen and I

943
1:0:7,866 --> 1:0:11,333
are having people over
for Christmas, and...

944
1:0:11,366 --> 1:0:14,899
we would love it if you and
Hardin and Tessa could join us.

945
1:0:14,933 --> 1:0:19,233
Well, I'm leaving for London
today, but, um...

946
1:0:19,266 --> 1:0:21,633
the flight's not
until this evening,

947
1:0:21,667 --> 1:0:23,800
so I think we can pop over.

948
1:0:23,833 --> 1:0:25,400
It would mean the world to me.

949
1:0:25,433 --> 1:0:28,833
I guess we'll see you later,
then.

950
1:0:28,866 --> 1:0:31,166
Merry Christmas, Trish.

951
1:0:33,433 --> 1:0:34,933
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

952
1:0:34,966 --> 1:0:36,66
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

953
1:0:36,100 --> 1:0:38,233
Oh! I'm so proud of you.

954
1:0:38,667 --> 1:0:40,966
Can't wait to meet her.

955
1:1:4,433 --> 1:1:6,733
This is his <i>house?</i>

956
1:1:7,799 --> 1:1:10,133
- I told you.
- For fuck's sake,

957
1:1:10,166 --> 1:1:12,866
I didn't think it was <i>this</i> big.

958
1:1:12,899 --> 1:1:14,866
Mum, we don't have to do this.

959
1:1:14,899 --> 1:1:19,133
Look, the last time I saw
your dad was ten years ago.

960
1:1:19,166 --> 1:1:21,366
It's time. Come on.

961
1:1:25,733 --> 1:1:27,366
- Hi. Karen?
- Yes, hi.

962
1:1:27,400 --> 1:1:28,799
Thank you for having us.

he just co-authored

of <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>

979
1:2:31,833 --> 1:2:33,354

1:2:33,366 --> 1:2:35,766

995

Well, I'm glad you stopped by.

996
1:3:29,133 --> 1:3:30,833
Me too.

997
1:3:30,866 --> 1:3:32,799
Dinner should be ready shortly.

998
1:3:32,833 --> 1:3:35,334
Okay, I hope everybody
has a hearty appetite.

999
1:3:35,367 --> 1:3:37,401
- Absolutely!
- Karen is a dynamite cook.

1000
1:3:37,434 --> 1:3:39,367
Yes, she is.

1001
1:3:39,401 --> 1:3:41,133
Where'd you go?

1002
1:3:41,166 --> 1:3:42,866
Just for a walk.

1003
1:3:42,899 --> 1:3:44,666
So Trish,
I hear that

1004
1:3:44,699 --> 1:3:46,88
this is your first time
in the States?

1005
1:3:46,100 --> 1:3:48,66
- Yeah, it is.
- And how do you like it?

1006
1:3:48,100 --> 1:3:50,200
There's a lot to see.

1007
1:3:50,233 --> 1:3:53,300
It's kind of worn out
its welcome, if you ask me.

1008
1:3:53,334 --> 1:3:56,632
Be happy to get back home
once I graduate.

1009
1:3:56,666 --> 1:3:59,266
You're moving back to England
after graduation?

1010
1:3:59,301 --> 1:4:1,599
Yeah, of course I am.

1011
1:4:1,833 --> 1:4:4,699
Trish, can I get you
another glass before you leave us?

1012
1:4:4,732 --> 1:4:6,301
No. But it was lovely.
Thank you.

1013
1:4:6,334 --> 1:4:7,933
I'm so glad you like it.

1014
1:4:7,966 --> 1:4:9,699
We got it in Greece
on our honeymoon.

1015
1:4:9,732 --> 1:4:11,866
I stuck to Pellegrino.

1016
1:4:11,899 --> 1:4:15,33
We stayed in
this gorgeous villa.

1017
1:4:15,334 --> 1:4:18,666
Did you know that
the beaches in Santorini

1018
1:4:18,699 --> 1:4:20,833
are made up of volcanic pebbles,

1019
1:4:20,866 --> 1:4:23,999
so there's no sand
to make the water murky.

1020
1:4:24,33 --> 1:4:26,233
So it is a crystal-clear...

1021
1:4:26,266 --> 1:4:28,899
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Hardin.

1022
1:4:28,933 --> 1:4:31,166
- Excuse me?
- Look at your fucking trousers.

1023
1:4:31,200 --> 1:4:32,799
I'm sorry, Mum,
but seriously,

1024
1:4:32,833 --> 1:4:34,632
do you have any sensitivity
whatsoever?

1025
1:4:34,666 --> 1:4:37,33
You're just boorishly droning on

1026
1:4:37,66 --> 1:4:39,133
with no regard for
the lives you destroyed.

1027
1:4:39,166 --> 1:4:42,866
P-Perhaps we could find
a more private place

1028
1:4:42,899 --> 1:4:45,966
- to have this conversation.
- By all means.

1029
1:4:45,999 --> 1:4:48,599
It's Bill Gates.

1030
1:4:50,33 --> 1:4:52,766
Okay, well, you are obviously
quite upset with me,

1031
1:4:52,799 --> 1:4:55,166
so go ahead and say
what's on your mind.

1032
1:4:55,200 --> 1:4:57,66
Why did you even invite us here?

1033
1:4:57,100 --> 1:4:59,33
I invited you here
because you're my family.

1034
1:4:59,66 --> 1:5:1,233
We're not your family.
We <i>were</i> your family.

1035
1:5:1,267 --> 1:5:3,921
- You ran out and reinvented...
- Hardin, I thought we were past this.

1036
1:5:3,933 --> 1:5:6,401
We didn't get past it. How were
we supposed to get past it?

1037
1:5:6,434 --> 1:5:8,899
You haven't owned up
to anything!

1038
1:5:8,933 --> 1:5:11,33
Your twelve steps...
making amends.

1039
1:5:11,66 --> 1:5:13,966
Where's Mum's amends?
Mum, have you got your amends yet?

1040
1:5:13,999 --> 1:5:15,666
What would you like me to do?

1041
1:5:15,699 --> 1:5:17,88
You don't think that
I am consumed by guilt?

1042
1:5:17,100 --> 1:5:19,699
I knew that night
that I had to go.

1043
1:5:19,732 --> 1:5:21,899
No! After that night
you had to <i>stay!</i>

1044
1:5:21,933 --> 1:5:24,166
And you didn't!
That night happened <i>because</i> of you!

1045
1:5:24,200 --> 1:5:26,632
Yes! And I have been haunted
by it for the last ten years!

1046
1:5:26,666 --> 1:5:29,133
It haunts you?!
I fucking watched it happen,

1047
1:5:29,166 --> 1:5:32,33
you bastard!

1048
1:5:37,334 --> 1:5:39,666
I'm sorry, Mum.

1049
1:5:39,699 --> 1:5:41,766
I <i>had</i> to.

1050
1:5:42,334 --> 1:5:45,866
No, wait. You don't have to get an Uber.
I can give you a ride.

1051
1:5:45,899 --> 1:5:48,201
After the shit
you've just pulled?

1052
1:5:48,234 --> 1:5:50,899
Not to mention you're drunk.

1053
1:5:50,933 --> 1:5:52,999
Look, I'm sorry
I'm not like you.

1054
1:5:53,33 --> 1:5:55,899
You may be able to forget
everything he did, but I can't.

1055
1:5:55,933 --> 1:5:58,334
I haven't forgotten anything.

1056
1:5:58,367 --> 1:6:2,866
I've <i>chosen</i> to forgive him
so that <i>I</i> can move on.

1057
1:6:3,766 --> 1:6:7,401
Hardin, resentments like this
are gonna destroy you.

1058
1:6:7,434 --> 1:6:12,133

who worked the day after Christmas.

1085
1:8:13,433 --> 1:8:16,167
We have gotta stop
meeting like this.

1086
1:8:16,201 --> 1:8:20,267
You're right. I'll have restraining
orders drafted immediately.

1087
1:8:20,301 --> 1:8:21,999
How was your Christmas?

1088
1:8:22,33 --> 1:8:24,134
Uneventful. Yours?

1089
1:8:24,899 --> 1:8:26,999
Eventful.

1090
1:8:27,234 --> 1:8:29,833
That's a loaded response.

1091
1:8:32,366 --> 1:8:35,167
Well, I'd love to hear more
about your eventful Christmas,

1092
1:8:35,201 --> 1:8:36,966
so... lunch?

1093
1:8:36,999 --> 1:8:38,301
Postmates. I'm buying.

1094
1:8:38,333 --> 1:8:40,301
How could I refuse?

1095
1:8:40,333 --> 1:8:42,933
Great. I'll email you
some menus.

1096
1:8:42,966 --> 1:8:45,833
I know,
very chivalrous of me.

1097
1:8:49,333 --> 1:8:54,101
I thought that things were
getting better, but...

1098
1:8:54,134 --> 1:8:58,34
it's clear that he still has a
lot of stuff he has to deal with.

1099
1:8:58,67 --> 1:9:1,201
And I just feel
really bad for him...

1100
1:9:1,234 --> 1:9:3,833
and I don't know how to fix it.

1101
1:9:3,866 --> 1:9:6,167
Well, let me ask you this.

1102
1:9:7,201 --> 1:9:9,632
Are you in love with him?

1103
1:9:10,366 --> 1:9:13,899
- I am.
- Then you got yourself a problem.

1104
1:9:15,933 --> 1:9:17,766
Those are your words of wisdom?

1105
1:9:17,799 --> 1:9:20,167
Hey, I never said I had
any words of wisdom.

1106
1:9:20,201 --> 1:9:25,699
No, you just wanted to know
whether I actually loved him.

1107
1:9:25,732 --> 1:9:28,34
I should get back to work.

1108
1:9:29,400 --> 1:9:32,101
Thank you for lunch.
Next time it's on me.

1109
1:9:32,134 --> 1:9:35,400
I don't think there's
gonna be a next time.

1110
1:9:35,433 --> 1:9:36,933
Ouch.

1111
1:9:36,967 --> 1:9:39,666
No, not like that,
believe me.

1112
1:9:39,699 --> 1:9:41,366
I'm moving to Seattle.

1113
1:9:41,400 --> 1:9:44,300
Vance offered me the Head of
Finance position at the new office.

1114
1:9:44,333 --> 1:9:46,201
Oh, my God.
Trevor, that's amazing.

1115
1:9:46,234 --> 1:9:48,167
Thanks.

1116
1:9:48,201 --> 1:9:50,333
Well, ya know,
I don't leave tomorrow.

1117
1:9:50,366 --> 1:9:52,134
We could still... that's...

1118
1:9:52,167 --> 1:9:54,933
No, that's stupid.

1119
1:10:3,134 --> 1:10:5,233
Tessa.

1120
1:10:5,934 --> 1:10:11,366
My sister has struggled
with addiction her whole life.

1121
1:10:11,400 --> 1:10:13,666
This thing between
you and Hardin...

1122
1:10:13,699 --> 1:10:15,934
it's not gonna end well.

1123
1:10:19,433 --> 1:10:21,732
Well, you're wrong.

1124
1:10:58,934 --> 1:11:1,333
This one's better anyway.

1125
1:11:14,266 --> 1:11:18,300
You're never gonna show me what
you're writing in there, are you?

1126
1:11:18,333 --> 1:11:20,632
Maybe... someday.

1127
1:11:28,67 --> 1:11:30,0
You don't wanna see who that is?

1128
1:11:30,34 --> 1:11:32,134
I know who it is.

1129
1:11:32,166 --> 1:11:33,766
It's Steph.

1130
1:11:33,799 --> 1:11:38,0
The frat house is having
a New Year's Eve party.

1131
1:11:38,34 --> 1:11:40,133
Right.

1132
1:11:40,366 --> 1:11:42,34
Do you wanna go?

1133
1:11:42,67 --> 1:11:45,732
No. I don't wanna
leave you here alone.

1134
1:11:46,400 --> 1:11:48,732
I wouldn't be alone.

1135
1:11:48,766 --> 1:11:50,867
I'd go with you.

1136
1:11:52,67 --> 1:11:55,200
Sorry, I... I just thought
after everything that happened

1137
1:11:55,233 --> 1:11:57,89
- that you wouldn't want to...
- I'm not scared of them.

1138
1:11:57,101 --> 1:11:59,266
Besides, if it
blows up in my face,

1139
1:11:59,300 --> 1:12:2,632
then we can just
stay in next year.

1140
1:12:12,100 --> 1:12:14,200
What was that for?

1141
1:12:17,34 --> 1:12:20,632
I just loved
how you said "next year."

1142
1:12:26,366 --> 1:12:27,900
Hello?

1143
1:12:27,934 --> 1:12:29,334
Tessa, why aren't you
in the office?

1144
1:12:29,366 --> 1:12:31,34
Well, yeah, I...
I thought it was...

1145
1:12:31,67 --> 1:12:32,400
I'm kidding.
Happy New Year.

1146
1:12:32,433 --> 1:12:34,867
Yes!

1147
1:12:34,900 --> 1:12:36,632
You got me.

1148
1:12:36,666 --> 1:12:38,300
<i>I'll cut to the chase.</i>

1149
1:12:38,333 --> 1:12:40,266
We went with the manuscript
you recommended,

1150
1:12:40,300 --> 1:12:42,333
and it sold today
in quite a bidding war.

1151
1:12:42,366 --> 1:12:45,233
Wow, that's... that's fantastic.

1152
1:12:45,266 --> 1:12:47,34
<i>Listen, we were
gonna hire someone</i>

1153
1:12:47,66 --> 1:12:48,786
<i>to do digital submissions
in Seattle, but...</i>

1154
1:12:48,800 --> 1:12:51,200
you're better than anyone
I've interviewed.

1155
1:12:51,233 --> 1:12:53,654
<i>I'll take care of your tuition,
living expenses, provided you transfer.</i>

1156
1:12:53,666 --> 1:12:57,333
Obviously, Hardin's welcome
to join you.

1157
1:12:57,366 --> 1:12:58,666
Wow, that...

1158
1:12:58,699 --> 1:13:1,666
uh, that sounds really amazing.

1159
1:13:2,599 --> 1:13:6,133
Um, can you give me a chance
to think about it, please?

1160
1:13:6,166 --> 1:13:7,767
<i>Of course. I just wanted</i>

1161
1:13:7,800 --> 1:13:9,133
to share the good news.

1162
1:13:9,166 --> 1:13:11,34
Happy New Year, Tess.

1163
1:13:11,66 --> 1:13:13,166
Happy New Year, sir.

1164
1:13:15,967 --> 1:13:17,300
Hey.

1165
1:13:17,333 --> 1:13:19,333
Were you talking to me?

1166
1:13:19,366 --> 1:13:20,834
Nope.

1167
1:13:20,867 --> 1:13:23,100
What is taking so long?

1168
1:13:23,133 --> 1:13:24,834
Being a woman.

1169
1:13:24,867 --> 1:13:27,100
Now, can you go wait outside?

1170
1:13:27,133 --> 1:13:29,233
- So sorry.
- Thanks.

1171
1:13:39,66 --> 1:13:41,166
Undefeated!

1172
1:13:42,0 --> 1:13:43,366
Fuck!

1173
1:13:43,400 --> 1:13:46,100
- It's okay.
- Sorry. Sorry.

1174
1:13:48,900 --> 1:13:50,400
We've missed you.

1175
1:13:50,433 --> 1:13:51,699
Are we good?

1176
1:13:51,733 --> 1:13:53,400
Ancient history.

1177
1:13:53,433 --> 1:13:54,967
You guys wanna get in on this?

1178
1:13:54,999 --> 1:13:56,233
Yeah, you can take my place.

1179
1:13:56,266 --> 1:13:58,366
Go. I'll watch.

1180
1:13:59,333 --> 1:14:0,934
I like to watch.

1181
1:14:0,967 --> 1:14:3,133
Yeah, I bet you do.

1182
1:14:3,166 --> 1:14:5,233
Okay, sure.

1183
1:14:5,533 --> 1:14:7,33
You know what you're doing,
right?

1184
1:14:7,66 --> 1:14:9,100
- Not a clue.
- Awesome.

1185
1:14:9,133 --> 1:14:11,233
Great.

1186
1:14:13,100 --> 1:14:15,599
Steph, Tristan: Tessa!

1187
1:14:16,800 --> 1:14:18,133
Mmm.

1188
1:14:18,166 --> 1:14:19,300
Mm.

1189
1:14:19,333 --> 1:14:20,666
What is that?

1190
1:14:20,700 --> 1:14:22,266
Cherry vodka sour.

1191
1:14:22,300 --> 1:14:24,599
Cool.

1192
1:14:28,767 --> 1:14:30,867
This is fun!

1193
1:14:35,834 --> 1:14:37,934
- Yes!
- Yes!

1194
1:14:43,266 --> 1:14:46,266
Drink, bitch!

1195
1:14:46,300 --> 1:14:48,366
Whoo! I like this!

1196
1:14:48,400 --> 1:14:51,200
- Nice job! One more!
- Aowww!

1197
1:15:0,100 --> 1:15:2,599
I... suck at this.

1198
1:15:3,867 --> 1:15:5,966
Jamie. Hey.

1199
1:15:8,400 --> 1:15:10,667
- It <i>is</i> you.
- Hi.

1200
1:15:11,33 --> 1:15:12,900
Can I talk to you upstairs?

1201
1:15:12,933 --> 1:15:15,33
Lead the way.

1202
1:15:28,900 --> 1:15:30,999
Molly's here!

1203
1:15:32,333 --> 1:15:34,633
You fucking kidding me?

1204
1:15:36,266 --> 1:15:38,366
Fuck this.

1205
1:15:41,999 --> 1:15:44,300
So cool,
all those gears.

1206
1:15:44,767 --> 1:15:46,767
You're like a robot.

1207
1:15:46,800 --> 1:15:48,200
Who says I'm not?

1208
1:15:48,233 --> 1:15:50,867
I have a tattoo
of a little butterfly,

1209
1:15:50,899 --> 1:15:53,767
but you can only see it
when I'm naked.

1210
1:15:53,800 --> 1:15:55,867
- I love butterflies.
- Really?

1211
1:15:55,899 --> 1:15:57,966
Yeah.

1212
1:16:3,999 --> 1:16:6,767
Hey!
I was looking for you.

1213
1:16:6,800 --> 1:16:8,899
Hey. Let's leave.

1214
1:16:9,266 --> 1:16:11,366
Okay.

1215
1:16:15,999 --> 1:16:20,133
Aww. If it isn't the cute
couple together again.

1216
1:16:20,166 --> 1:16:22,300
Oh, yay. It's Molly.

1217
1:16:22,333 --> 1:16:24,133
- Where you guys going?
- We're going home.

1218
1:16:24,166 --> 1:16:27,66
Ohh. Lame. Come on,
it's almost New Year's.

1219
1:16:27,100 --> 1:16:29,899
- We just wanna be alone.
- Let's go.

1220
1:16:29,933 --> 1:16:33,633
Good. She never really
fit in, anyway.

1221
1:16:34,999 --> 1:16:36,333
One drink.

1222
1:16:36,366 --> 1:16:38,700
What... Tess.

1223
1:16:45,100 --> 1:16:49,66
Excuse me, lovebirds,
you're on my chair.

1224
1:16:49,366 --> 1:16:51,800
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Now, fuck off.

1225
1:16:51,833 --> 1:16:53,100
Move.

1226
1:16:53,133 --> 1:16:55,233
Bitch.

1227
1:17:1,933 --> 1:17:4,233
Yes, I am <i>druuuunk!</i>

1228
1:17:5,899 --> 1:17:8,88
Would anybody like some weed brownies?
I made 'em myself.

1229
1:17:8,100 --> 1:17:10,200
- No.
- Oh, I'm good.

1230
1:17:10,866 --> 1:17:13,266
Well, this is fun.
Can we leave?

1231
1:17:13,300 --> 1:17:14,667
We should play a game.

1232
1:17:14,700 --> 1:17:15,966
Like what, Scrabble?

1233
1:17:15,999 --> 1:17:17,799
How about...

1234
1:17:17,833 --> 1:17:20,133
- Truth or Dare?
- Jesus Christ.

1235
1:17:20,166 --> 1:17:22,200
- Why is that bad?
- Long story.

1236
1:17:22,233 --> 1:17:24,700
- Why would you say that?
- Because.

1237
1:17:24,733 --> 1:17:28,233
What's the matter, Hardin?
Scared of a little Truth or Dare?

1238
1:17:28,266 --> 1:17:30,366
Fuck you, Molly.

1239
1:17:30,600 --> 1:17:31,933
I'll go first.

1240
1:17:31,966 --> 1:17:33,999
Hey, Tess, truth or dare?

1241
1:17:34,33 --> 1:17:35,700
Truth.

1242
1:17:35,733 --> 1:17:37,233
Uh, are you a virgin?

1243
1:17:37,266 --> 1:17:38,933
Molly, don't.

1244
1:17:38,966 --> 1:17:41,166
Oh. Duh. I already know
the answer to that,

1245
1:17:41,200 --> 1:17:42,833
because Hardin fucked you.

1246
1:17:42,866 --> 1:17:44,899
Yes, he did.

1247
1:17:44,933 --> 1:17:47,300
My turn. Molly,
truth or dare?

1248
1:17:47,333 --> 1:17:49,633
Hmm, truth.

1249
1:17:51,733 --> 1:17:53,633
Is it true that you're a whore?

1250
1:17:53,667 --> 1:17:55,233
Oh, shit.

1251
1:17:55,266 --> 1:17:57,633
What the fuck did
you just call me?

1252
1:17:57,667 --> 1:18:0,766
I didn't call you anything.
I just asked you a question.

1253
1:18:0,799 --> 1:18:2,667
Are you a whore?

1254
1:18:2,700 --> 1:18:4,733
- You are.
- You have to answer honestly,

1255
1:18:4,766 --> 1:18:7,733
because it's called
Truth for a reason.

1256
1:18:7,766 --> 1:18:9,899
No.

1257
1:18:9,933 --> 1:18:11,133
Do they not like each other?

1258
1:18:11,166 --> 1:18:12,733
Hey, Tess,
my turn again.

1259
1:18:12,766 --> 1:18:14,333
- Truth or dare?
- Truth.

1260
1:18:14,366 --> 1:18:15,899
Is it true that
you're a dumb-ass

1261
1:18:15,933 --> 1:18:17,766
for getting back together
with Hardin

1262
1:18:17,799 --> 1:18:19,833
after he clearly fucked you
for a bet?

1263
1:18:19,866 --> 1:18:21,966
Let's go.

1264
1:18:22,266 --> 1:18:23,766
No, that's not true.

1265
1:18:23,799 --> 1:18:25,899
Oh... but it is.

1266
1:18:25,933 --> 1:18:27,966
You believe anything
that comes out of his mouth.

1267
1:18:27,999 --> 1:18:29,766
I fucking hate you, Molly.

1268
1:18:29,799 --> 1:18:31,200
Which I don't blame you,

1269
1:18:31,233 --> 1:18:33,933
because, oh, man,
what that mouth can do.

1270
1:18:33,966 --> 1:18:36,66
And that tongue...

1271
1:18:46,999 --> 1:18:49,100
Get away from me!

1272
1:18:53,100 --> 1:18:55,667
- You, like that, whore!
- Ohh!

1273
1:19:5,33 --> 1:19:7,100
Tessa, relax!

1274
1:19:7,799 --> 1:19:8,799
Awww...

1275
1:19:11,833 --> 1:19:13,366
You're a <i>whore!</i>

1276
1:19:13,401 --> 1:19:15,333
Get that fuckin' bitch
out of here!

1277
1:19:15,366 --> 1:19:17,300
Happy new year, bitch!

1278
1:19:17,333 --> 1:19:18,866
Fuck you, Tessa!

1279
1:19:18,899 --> 1:19:20,999
Get off me!

1280
1:19:21,333 --> 1:19:23,266
And you, move the fuck
out of my way!

1281
1:19:29,732 --> 1:19:33,200
- ...UFC or some..
- UFC?

1282
1:19:34,866 --> 1:19:37,166
I needed that.

1283
1:19:37,200 --> 1:19:39,300
I'll bet you did.

1284
1:19:39,600 --> 1:19:41,666
- Ahhh.
- You're crazy.

1285
1:19:41,699 --> 1:19:43,799

1312
1:21:13,301 --> 1:21:15,599
We're set.

1313
1:21:16,301 --> 1:21:18,599
Hey.

1314
1:21:21,966 --> 1:21:24,666
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

1315
1:21:29,699 --> 1:21:32,267
Tessa, your phone.

1316
1:21:32,301 --> 1:21:35,66
<i>- What?</i>
- Your phone.

1317
1:21:52,434 --> 1:21:54,866
Hardin?

1318
1:21:56,401 --> 1:21:58,66
Hey, you!

1319
1:21:58,100 --> 1:22:0,234
- Happy New Year.
- Hey.

1320
1:22:0,933 --> 1:22:2,401
I'm really glad we did that.

1321
1:22:2,434 --> 1:22:4,33
Me too.

1322
1:22:4,66 --> 1:22:5,833
Do me a favor and just
keep it between us?

1323
1:22:5,866 --> 1:22:8,699
Of course.
I never kiss and tell.

1324
1:22:8,732 --> 1:22:10,833
Thank you.

1325
1:22:11,732 --> 1:22:13,301
Uh-oh.

1326
1:22:13,334 --> 1:22:15,401
You piece of shit!

1327
1:22:17,833 --> 1:22:19,66
Tessa, wait!

1328
1:22:19,100 --> 1:22:22,66
- Hey. Hey!
- Just hear me out.

1329
1:22:22,100 --> 1:22:23,999
What the fuck?!

1330
1:22:24,33 --> 1:22:25,966
- Dude, she kissed <i>me.</i>
- Fuck off!

1331
1:22:25,999 --> 1:22:29,33
Tessa, what the fuck!
How can you do that?!

1332
1:22:29,66 --> 1:22:31,301
Why do you care, huh?
You just kissed that girl.

1333
1:22:31,334 --> 1:22:33,100
No, no, no,
you don't get to cry!

1334
1:22:33,133 --> 1:22:35,401
You just fucking kissed a guy
right in front of me!

1335
1:22:35,434 --> 1:22:37,401
- And what did you do, huh?
- Nothing!

1336
1:22:37,434 --> 1:22:39,301
- The fuck is wrong with you?!
- She just said

1337
1:22:39,334 --> 1:22:42,799
that she doesn't kiss and tell,
you fucking liar!

1338
1:22:42,833 --> 1:22:44,732
It's a figure of speech!

1339
1:22:44,766 --> 1:22:46,866
You should know I would
never fucking cheat on you!

1340
1:22:46,899 --> 1:22:51,201
Were you with her tonight? Is she who
you disappeared with the whole night?!

1341
1:22:51,234 --> 1:22:53,167
Yes!

1342
1:22:53,201 --> 1:22:55,732
- I was trying to make her forgive me.
- For what?!

1343
1:22:55,766 --> 1:23:0,267
Because I'm trying to be a better
person for you! That's all I fucking do!

1344
1:23:0,301 --> 1:23:3,732
Tell me what else I can do to
make you believe that I love you.

1345
1:23:3,766 --> 1:23:5,799
Tell me!

1346
1:23:5,833 --> 1:23:7,899
You're never gonna trust me.

1347
1:23:7,933 --> 1:23:9,732
Trust you?

1348
1:23:9,766 --> 1:23:11,133
You think that
I should trust you.

1349
1:23:11,167 --> 1:23:12,234
Yes!

1350
1:23:12,267 --> 1:23:15,100
Where has that ever gotten me?

1351
1:23:15,732 --> 1:23:18,766
You're never gonna
forgive me, are you?

1352
1:23:18,799 --> 1:23:21,167
You're just gonna keep bringing it
up, every time.

1353
1:23:21,201 --> 1:23:23,799
Because I don't trust you!

1354
1:23:24,100 --> 1:23:27,367
You act like
you're so fucking innocent.

1355
1:23:27,401 --> 1:23:29,201

1356
1:23:29,234 --> 1:23:30,999
Oh, fuck this.

<i>- Mercy Hospital.</i>
- Hello, yes?

- Theresa Young. She's 19.

- She should be there.

How could you do this to Tessa?

1:26:17,134 --> 1:26:18,687

1395
1:26:25,0 --> 1:26:26,833
You didn't come home last night!

1396
1:26:26,866 --> 1:26:28,967
Get off of me!

1397
1:26:30,366 --> 1:26:32,333
She was out looking for you.

1398
1:26:32,366 --> 1:26:34,666
I don't believe you.

- I'm with her now.

1403

- That's not gonna happen.

fucking playing with you!

Trevor, please,
just let me talk to her.

Give her a chance to find
happiness in this life,

gonna find it with you.

Hardin, what happened
that night,

1479
1:30:53,400 --> 1:30:55,66
it wasn't his fault.

1480

1:30:57,366 --> 1:30:59,666
Not his fault?

1:31:1,200 --> 1:31:3,300
Yeah, it was shit.

1483
1:31:3,599 --> 1:31:6,700
It was shit, and we both
deserved better.

1484

But the only person
you're punishing

1485
1:31:8,300 --> 1:31:10,33
by not forgiving him
is yourself.

1486
1:31:10,66 --> 1:31:14,767
And Hardin, I want you
to stop punishing yourself.

1487
1:31:15,632 --> 1:31:17,800
So you think it's fair
that he gets to live in

1488
1:31:17,834 --> 1:31:21,400
that big, fancy house,
and you're here all alone?

1489
1:31:21,433 --> 1:31:23,700
Who said I was alone?

1490
1:31:23,733 --> 1:31:26,66
What?
You're seeing someone?

1491
1:31:26,100 --> 1:31:30,200
- You don't have to sound so surprised.
- Who?

1492
1:31:30,533 --> 1:31:32,834
- Mike.
- Mike?

1493
1:31:33,133 --> 1:31:35,900
- Wanker-from-next-door Mike?
- He's <i>not</i> a wanker!

1494
1:31:35,934 --> 1:31:38,667
- He is a bit of a wanker.
- He's a really nice man,

1495
1:31:38,700 --> 1:31:40,667
and he treats me well.

1496
1:31:40,700 --> 1:31:42,999
Yeah, he fucking better.

1497
1:31:43,767 --> 1:31:47,200
Did you hear that Vance
was moving to Seattle?

1498
1:31:47,233 --> 1:31:49,767
Tessa's going too.
How did you know?

1499
1:31:49,800 --> 1:31:51,800
Well, we talk from time to time.

1500
1:31:51,834 --> 1:31:54,66
He's having a going-away
party on Sunday,

1501
1:31:54,100 --> 1:31:57,733
and I think you should get your
ass off this sofa and go get her.

1502
1:31:57,767 --> 1:32:2,33
- No, I can't.
- Can't? Or you don't want to face what you left behind?

1503
1:32:2,66 --> 1:32:3,333
I'd have to leave right now.

1504
1:32:3,366 --> 1:32:5,767
So what are you waiting for?

1505
1:32:5,800 --> 1:32:8,366
- Mum, I'm not gonna...
- Hardin...

1506
1:32:8,400 --> 1:32:14,733
I love you, but you <i>have</i> to start
fighting for what really matters.

1507
1:32:24,667 --> 1:32:26,366
<i>Thank you all
so much for coming.</i>

1508
1:32:26,400 --> 1:32:30,633
It means the world to me to have
everyone I love here with us.

1509
1:32:30,667 --> 1:32:32,767
I am... beyond proud

1510
1:32:33,66 --> 1:32:34,999
of the work that everyone
in this room has done,

1511
1:32:35,33 --> 1:32:36,999
but there is one
particular person

1512
1:32:37,33 --> 1:32:39,233
I could not have done
any of this without.

1513
1:32:39,266 --> 1:32:40,700
And that's Kimberly.

1514
1:32:46,333 --> 1:32:48,300
Smith and I were talking
the other day,

1515
1:32:48,333 --> 1:32:50,354
and he said, "Dad,
going-away parties are kind of sad."

1516
1:32:50,366 --> 1:32:52,300
And he's got a point.

1517
1:32:52,333 --> 1:32:54,899
And we were like,
"How do we make this a celebration?"

1518
1:32:54,933 --> 1:32:56,999
Then we got an idea.

1519
1:33:1,866 --> 1:33:4,999
Kimberly...

1520
1:33:5,899 --> 1:33:8,966
will you marry my dad
and be my stepmom?

1521
1:33:8,999 --> 1:33:11,100
Aww...

1522
1:33:12,100 --> 1:33:14,300
Yes!

1523
1:33:14,333 --> 1:33:16,200
Yes!

1524
1:33:20,233 --> 1:33:21,833
What about me?

1525
1:33:24,100 --> 1:33:26,733
- Aww...
- Yay!

1526
1:33:37,966 --> 1:33:39,733
Who said happy endings
don't exist?

1527
1:33:39,767 --> 1:33:41,333
Don't tell me.
You're the cynic.

1528
1:33:41,366 --> 1:33:44,233
I'm turning over a new leaf.

1529
1:33:44,266 --> 1:33:47,200
You look very pretty,
by the way.

1530
1:33:47,233 --> 1:33:51,733
So... have you made up
your mind about Seattle?

1531
1:33:51,966 --> 1:33:54,366
Well, I don't see
much of a reason

1532
1:33:54,400 --> 1:33:57,899
to pass up the opportunity
anymore.

1533
1:33:59,233 --> 1:34:0,700
That's...

1534
1:34:0,733 --> 1:34:1,733
really nice to hear.

1535
1:34:3,400 --> 1:34:5,233
Look, Tessa,
there's something

1536
1:34:5,266 --> 1:34:7,266
I actually want
to get off my chest.

1537
1:34:7,300 --> 1:34:9,600
Okay.

1538
1:34:9,866 --> 1:34:13,233
Uh, the other day,
in the hospital...

1539
1:34:13,266 --> 1:34:15,133
I answered your cell phone,

1540
1:34:15,166 --> 1:34:16,966
it was Hardin,

1541
1:34:16,999 --> 1:34:20,200
and I told him
to stay away from you.

1542
1:34:20,233 --> 1:34:22,100
- What?
- In retrospect,

1543
1:34:22,133 --> 1:34:24,766
I do realize that
that was over the line,

1544
1:34:24,799 --> 1:34:28,733
and I do realize that I let my
emotions get the best of me,

1545
1:34:28,766 --> 1:34:30,866
and I'm sorry,

1546
1:34:30,899 --> 1:34:35,33
but somehow you bring
that side out of me, so...

1547
1:34:36,300 --> 1:34:38,600
Okay.

1548
1:34:40,233 --> 1:34:42,33
Are you okay?

1549
1:34:42,66 --> 1:34:43,933
Eh.

1550
1:34:43,966 --> 1:34:46,133
There's actually
more I'd like to say,

1551
1:34:46,166 --> 1:34:47,954
- but would you excuse me for a second?
- Yeah.

1552
1:34:47,966 --> 1:34:50,66
Thanks.

1553
1:35:12,33 --> 1:35:14,133
I'm so sorry.

1554
1:35:25,799 --> 1:35:27,899
Shit.

1555
1:35:31,732 --> 1:35:33,66
She left from the front.

1556
1:35:33,100 --> 1:35:35,200
Thank you.

1557
1:35:39,699 --> 1:35:41,799
Tessa!

1558
1:35:55,366 --> 1:35:59,966
You're just never gonna
leave me alone, are you?

1559
1:36:22,966 --> 1:36:25,66

So... hey, so <i>I</i> was dreamin'
of a white Christmas.

1573
1:37:30,100 --> 1:37:31,966
Hmph! All I got was heat.

1574
1:37:31,999 --> 1:37:34,401
You know, I hate the heat.

Heat get into people's minds

1576
1:37:36,866 --> 1:37:39,799
and make them do
some crazy things.

Tess.

Tessa.

1618
1:40:10,966 --> 1:40:12,100
Tessa.

1619
1:40:12,134 --> 1:40:13,899
Do you like to go on dates?

1620
1:40:13,933 --> 1:40:15,234
Because I don't.

1621
1:40:15,267 --> 1:40:17,766
But I-I will... with you.

1622
1:40:18,699 --> 1:40:20,201
If you wanna go.

1623
1:40:21,899 --> 1:40:22,899
Tessa.

1624
1:40:22,933 --> 1:40:24,899
That's so creepy.

1625
1:40:24,933 --> 1:40:26,921
I've been meaning to tell you
something for a long time,

1626
1:40:26,933 --> 1:40:29,167
and the reason
that I haven't told you

1627
1:40:29,201 --> 1:40:31,632
is because of Human Resources
in the workplace.

1628
1:40:31,666 --> 1:40:33,201
Don't talk about
Human Resources.

1629
1:40:33,234 --> 1:40:34,999
That's not... sexy.

1630
1:40:35,33 --> 1:40:36,367
Tessa!

1631
1:40:36,400 --> 1:40:38,101
Don't do the finger.

1632
1:40:38,134 --> 1:40:39,267
Put it <i>down!</i>

1633
1:40:39,301 --> 1:40:41,632
I only pull out my teal suit

1634
1:40:41,666 --> 1:40:43,732
when I have something
important to say.

1635
1:40:43,766 --> 1:40:45,400
Occupied.

1636
1:40:45,433 --> 1:40:47,632
Tessa.

1637
1:40:47,666 --> 1:40:49,334
There's other bathrooms
in the house

1638
1:40:49,367 --> 1:40:52,66
if you need to go that badly.

1639
1:40:53,367 --> 1:40:55,833
Just go.

1640
1:40:55,866 --> 1:40:57,966
Yes. You can go now.
